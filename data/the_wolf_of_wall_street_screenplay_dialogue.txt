JORDAN

Twenty five grand to the first 
cocksucker to nail a bullseye!  

Watch and learn, people!

JORDAN (CONTD)

One.  Two.  Throw!!

JORDAN (CONTD)

JORDAN (V.O.) (CONTD)

My name is Jordan Belfort. No, not 
him, me. Im a former member of 
the middle class raised by two 
accountants in a tiny apartment in 
Bayside, Queens.  

JORDAN (V.O.) 

The year I turned 26, I made 49 
million dollars as the head of   
my own brokerage firm--

JORDAN (V.O.)

--which really pissed me off 
because it was three shy of a 
million a week.

JORDAN (V.O.)

Hey, my Ferrari was white, like 
Don Johnsons in Miami Vice.

JORDAN (V.O.) 

See that humongous estate down 
there?  Thats my house.   

JORDAN (V.O.)

My wife, Naomi, the Duchess of Bay 
Ridge, Brooklyn, a former model 
and Miller Lite girl.

JORDAN (V.O.)

Yeah, she was the one blowing me 
in the Ferrari, so put your dick 
back in your pants.     

JORDAN (V.O.)

In addition to Naomi and my two 
perfect kids, I own a mansion,    
private jet, six cars, three 
horses, two vacation homes and    
a 170 foot yacht. 

JORDAN  (V.O.)

I also gamble like a degenerate, 
drink like a fish, fuck hookers 
maybe five times a week and have 
three different Federal agencies 
looking to indict me.  

JORDAN (V.O.)
Oh yeah, and I love drugs. 

CAPTAIN DAVE

Pull up!  Jesus!  Were gonna 
crash!!

JORDAN (V.O.)

Check this out -- despite my 
completely fucked-up state, I 
could fly straight while still 
seeing two of everything.

JORDAN

(to Captain Dave)

Ya guzza git hazarous doozy pay, 
buddy.   

JORDAN  (V.O.)
Yes, on a daily basis I take 
enough drugs to sedate greater 
Long Island. 

JORDAN

I take Quaaludes for my back, 
fifteen to twenty a day.  

JORDAN (CONT'D)
I use Xanax to stay focused, 
ambien to sleep, pot to mellow 
out, cocaine to wake up and 
morphine because its awesome. 

JORDAN 

But of all the drugs under Gods 
blue heaven, theres one thats my 
absolute favorite.

JORDAN 

Enough of this shitll make you 
invincible, able to conquer the 
world and eviscerate your enemies.  

JORDAN (CONTD)

Im not talking about this.  Im 
talking about this.

(Jordan unfurls the 
$100 with a SNAP)

Money is the oxygen of capitalism 
and I wanna breathe more than any 
other human being alive.

JORDAN (V.O.)

Money doesnt just buy you a 
better life -- better food, better 
cars, better pussy -- it also 
makes you a better person.  You 
can give generously to the church 
of your choice or the political 
party.  You can save the fucking 
spotted owl with money.

JORDAN (V.O.)

But most of all, in any country in 
the world, money can buy you love.  
Fuck the Beatles.

JORDAN (V.O.)

With that in mind, at the tender 
age of 22, after marrying my 
girlfriend Teresa--

JORDAN (V.O.)

--I headed to the only place that   
befit my high-minded ambitions...

JERRY FOGEL (PRE-LAP)

You are lower than fucking pond 
scum.

JERRY FOGEL

You got a problem with that?

(reads name tag)

Jordan?

Nope.  No problem at all. 

JORDAN

JERRY FOGEL  

Your job is connector, which 
means you'll be dialing the phone 
over 500 times a day, trying to 
connect me with business owners.  
And till you pass your Series 7, 
thats all youll be doing.  Sit.

JERRY FOGEL (CONTD)
Just so you know, last year I made 
over 300k and the other guy you'll 
be working for made a million.

JORDAN (V.O.)

A million dollars?  I could only 
imagine what a douchebag that guy 
must be.

Jordan?  Mark Hanna.  

(re: Fogel)

MARK HANNA

Good, youve met Jerry.  One of 
the smartest guys in the office.  
Whos ever sucked a dogs cock out 
of loneliness.

JERRY FOGEL

Smile and dial.  And dont pick 
your fucking head up till one.

MARK HANNA 

Dont mind Jerry, his father raped 
him as a child.  Besides, I'm 
senior broker here, he's a 
worthless piker.  I heard you 
pitched stock at your job 
interview.

Had to do something to stand out.

JORDAN

MARK HANNA

I fuckin love that!  Lets grab 
lunch later.  Windows good with 
you?

Great.  Yeah.

JORDAN

Lets fuck!!

MARK HANNA

BROKER #1

(to Broker #2)

Miniscribe's a fuckin steal!  
Thirty eight bucks a share!

MARK HANNA

(into headset)

Your broker in West Virginia?  
What are you buying, a coal mine?  
It's the 80s, the game is high-
tech.

BROKER #2

(to Broker #3)

Fuckface!  I got 50,000 July 50s! 

JORDAN (V.O.)

You want to know what money sounds 
like?  Visit a trading floor on 
Wall Street.  Fuck this, shit 
that.  Cock, cunt, asshole.  I 
couldnt believe how these guys 
talked to each other--

JERRY FOGEL 
Dial the cocksucking phone!

I was hooked within seconds.    

JORDAN (V.O.)

It was like mainlining adrenaline. 

JORDAN (V.O.)

MARK HANNA

(offering the spoon)

Got enough for one more?  Tootski?

No.  Thanks though.

JORDAN

HECTOR

Mr. Hanna, what can I bring for 
you on this glorious afternoon?

MARK HANNA 

Heres the game plan, Hector. 
Bring  us two Absolut Martinis 
straight up.  Precisely seven and 
a half minutes after you deliver 
those youll bring two more, then 
two more every five minutes until 
one of us passes out.

An excellent strategy, sir. 

HECTOR

Actually, Im good with 7-Up.

JORDAN

MARK HANNA

First day on Wall Street, Hector.     
Give him time.

(Hector offers menus)
No thanks, Im not eating.

JORDAN 

You can get high during the day 
and still function?  

MARK HANNA

High is the only way to do this 
fucking job.  Guy who coined the 
term three-martini lunch was a 
woman.  Cocaine and hookers, my 
friend, the keys to success.  

JORDAN

I gotta say, Im really excited 
about being part of your team.    
I wanna do all I can for our 
clients and -- 

MARK HANNA

(reciting an ad)

Here at L.F. Rothschild, our 
clients arent just important, 
theyre family.  Just as long as 
we get our taste first.  Remember 
something, Jordan, your top 
priority in this job: make us 
money.  If the clients get rich 
along the way, bully for them.  
Got a girlfriend?

JORDAN
Wife.  She cuts hair.

MARK HANNA

OK, first rule of Wall Street.  
Nobody -- and I dont care if 
youre Warren Buffet or Jimmy 
Buffet -- nobody knows if a 
stocks going up, down or fucking 
sideways, least of all stock 
brokers.  But we have to pretend 
we know.  Make sure you stay 
relaxed.  Nobody wants to buy 
something from someone who sounds 
like they havent gotten laid in a 
month.  Take breaks when you feel 
stressed, jerk off if you can.  
You like jerking  off, right?

Well... sure.

JORDAN

MARK HANNA

Good, jerking off is key.  And I 
highly recommend cocaine, which 
will make you dial faster, which 
is good for me.  Churn em and 
burn em, baby.

JORDAN (V.O.) 

For the next six months I learned 
the ways of Wall Street.

JORDAN  (V.O.)

That fall I passed my Series 7.  
Finally it was here.  

JORDAN (V.O.)

My first day as a stockbroker, a 
future Master of the Universe.

JORDAN (V.O.)
They called it Black Monday.
By four p.m. the market was down 
508 points, the biggest one-day 
drop since the crash of 29. 

Holy.  Fucking.  Shit. 

MARK HANNA

JORDAN (V.O.)

L.F. Rothschild, a company that 
had been in business since 1883, 
closed its doors within a month.

TERESA

So Ill take an extra shift, dont 
worry about it.  

You work too much as it is. 

JORDAN

We could pawn my engagement ring.

TERESA

JORDAN 

Were not pawning anything.  Im 
gonna be a millionaire, Teresa.    

TERESA

You know that doesnt matter, 
right?

JORDAN 

(points to an ad)

Nobody Beats the Wiz.  I could 
be a stock boy. 

Youre a stock broker.

TERESA

JORDAN 

No ones hiring brokers right now, 
sweetie.

This place is.

TERESA 

Im looking for Investors Center?

JORDAN

Thats us, hey.  Dwayne.

DWAYNE

JORDAN

(as they shake hands)

Jordan Belfort, I called earlier.  
I was a broker with Rothschild.  

TOBY WELCH

Im tellin you, this stock is 
goin up!...  Cause I know, 
okay?!...  I have inside 
information!

Where are your quotrons?

JORDAN 

DWAYNE

No quotrons, we sell off the pink 
sheets -- penny stocks.

DWAYNE (CONTD)

Company dont have enough capital 
to be listed on NASDAQ, their 
shares trade here.  

(points to the book)

Like these guys, Aerotyne?  They 
make radar detectors out of a 
garage in Dubuque.  

JORDAN

Six cents a share?  Who buys this 
crap?

DWAYNE 

Schmucks mostly.  Mailmen, 
plumbers, people thinking they can 
get rich quick.  They answer our 
ads, Popular Mechanics, Hustler.       

The spread on these is huge.

JORDAN

DWAYNE 

Sos your commission, thats the 
point.  Blue chips stocks you get 
what, one percent?  Pink sheets 
are fifty. 

JORDAN

Wait a second.  Youre telling me 
if I sell two thousand dollars 
worth of stock, my commission is a 
thousand bucks?   

DWAYNE 

Technically, yeah, but not even 
the biggest schmuck buys two 
thousand dollars of this shit.

JORDAN

(into phone)

Mr. Fleming, good morning, Jordan 
Belfort with Investors Center in 
New York City.  You recently 
responded to one of our ads...  

JORDAN (CONTD)

The reason Im calling is that   
an extremely exciting investment 
opportunity crossed my desk today.  
Typically our firm recommends no 
more than five stocks per year: 
this is one of them...  

JORDAN (CONT'D)

Aerotyne International is a 
cutting edge tech firm out of the 
Midwest, awaiting imminent patent 
approval on a new generation of 
radar equipment...

JORDAN (CONTD)

-- so if Aerotynes shares rise    
to only a dollar -- and our 
research indicates they could go  
much, much higher -- your profit 
on a mere three thousand dollar 
investment would be upwards of 
fifty thousand...  Thats right, 
you could pay off your mortgage.  

JORDAN (CONTD)

Four thousand dollars, will    
that be check or money order?...     
Thank you, sir.

JORDAN  (V.O.) (CONTD)

Just like that I made two grand.    
The other guys looked at me like 
Id just discovered fire. 

Howd you fuckin do that?

TOBY WELCH

JORDAN 

Its a rock-solid company, sir, 
its the next Microsoft...      
Six thousand.  Terrific.

JORDAN (V.O.) (CONTD)

Though I knew I was selling 
garbage, within twelve weeks I  
was making a fortune.

JORDAN (V.O.)

And as a wise man once told me,  
my only responsibility was to   
put meat on the table.   

That your Jag in the lot?  

DONNIE 

Yeah.  

JORDAN

Nice ride.  Donnie Azoff.

DONNIE 

Jordan Belfort.

JORDAN

DONNIE 

Ive seen it around.  We live in 
the same building.  Twelfth floor?  

(Jordan nods)

What do you do, bro?

Stock broker.  

JORDAN 

DONNIE 

Kids furniture, me and my brother- 
in-law.  Making any money?  

Seventy grand last month.

JORDAN

DONNIE 

Get the fuck out.  You made 
seventy grand in one month.

JORDAN
Seventy two actually.

DONNIE 

Tell you what.  You show me a pay 
stub with $72,000 on it, Im 
quitting my job right now and 
coming to work with you. 

Holy shit. 

DONNIE (CONTD)

JORDAN (V.O.)

And he did quit his job, which    
I thought was a little weird.     
I mean I had just met this   
fucking guy.

DONNIE

Yo Paulie, its Donnie...  Yeah, 
listen, I quit. 

JORDAN (V.O.) 

There were other things about him 
too, like his phosphorescent white 
teeth and the fact that he wore 
horn rims with clear lenses to 
look more Waspy.  He also married 
his first cousin --

DONNIE 

No problem, if we have a kid whos 
a retard, well just leave it on 
the steps of some institution. 

JORDAN (V.O.)

He was also a closet drug fiend. 
Id known him less than a week 
before he talked me into smoking 
crack.

JORDAN (V.O.)

The weird thing was when hed do 
crack, his face would contort into 
this bizarre, frozen mask like the 
Phantom of the Opera.

You now, take a hit!

DONNIE 

Omigod, I fuckin love you!!

JORDAN

JORDAN (V.O.)
I knew I had to make him my 
partner.

JORDAN (V.O.)

Which turned out to be a great 
move - Donnie was a fast learner 
who transitioned into the penny 
stock business quickly.  

JORDAN (V.O.)

So within months we started our 
own firm out of an abandoned auto 
body shop.

JORDAN (V.O.)

In addition to Donnie, I also 
recruited my friends Sea Otter, 
Chester and Robbie, who were at 
the time all middling pot dealers. 

JORDAN

--see everyone wants to get rich, 
so youre already half way there 
by the time the call starts.

SEA OTTER

I sold weed once to this Amish  
dude, had one of those beards with 
no mustache?

So?  

ROBBIE FEINBERG

He only wanted to make furniture.  

SEA OTTER

CHESTER MING
Whats that got to do with 
anything? 

SEA OTTER

He just said everyone wants to  
get rich.

ROBBIE FEINBERG

(to Jordan)

Thats true, you did.  

SEA OTTER

Buddhists too, they dont give a 
shit about money either.

CHESTER MING

Man I could sell weed to anybody, 
get a convent full of nuns fucking 
wasted.  

JORDAN (V.O.)

Brad, the guy I really wanted, 
took a pass, since hed become the 
Quaalude king of Bayside. 

JORDAN (V.O.) 

They were absolute morons, my 
friends, but like I always said--

JORDAN (V.O.)

Give me them young, hungry and 
stupid and in no time Ill make 
them rich. 

Omigod.  Jordan.

TERESA 

You like it?

JORDAN

Its beautiful.

TERESA

JORDAN 

Theyre small, I know, but the 
stones are really high quality. 

No, no.  I love it.

TERESA

Then what?

JORDAN

TERESA

I dont know, its just -- these 
stocks, these crappy companies. 

JORDAN

In five years the Corleone family 
will be completely legitimate. 

Why cant you be legitimate now?

TERESA

JORDAN

Its not illegal, Teresa, 
technically.  I mean theyre real 
stocks, theyre just...

Never gonna make anybody money. 

(a few beats; then)

TERESA

Wouldnt you feel better selling 
this junk to rich people, who can 
afford to lose the money at least? 

JORDAN 

Rich people dont buy penny 
stocks.

Why not?

TERESA

JORDAN (V.O.)

Because theyre too smart, thats 
why not.

JORDAN (V.O.)

I mean what person of any 
substance would trust this bunch 
of jerk-offs?  Like the Pinhead, 
Robbie Feinberg. 

JORDAN (V.O.)

Toby Welch. I mean, look at this
fucking Cro-Magnon, I wouldnt 
trust him to pick up a rock.

JORDAN (V.O.)

Toby Welch. I mean, look at this
fucking Cro-Magnon, he couldnt 
even think without moving his 
lips.

Or the Sea Otter.

JORDAN (V.O.)

JORDAN (V.O.)

Chester Ming even, the Depraved 
Chinaman, with his giant panda 
head. 

JORDAN (V.O.)

Or Nicky Koskoff, who I called 
Rugrat because-- 

JORDAN (V.O.)

Well, you can probably figure that  
out for yourself. 

JORDAN (V.O.)

But what if they didnt sound like 
jerk-offs?  What if I took this 
bunch of nincompoops and molded 
them in my own image?  I 
reinvented the company, gave it a 
new image, a new name.  Something 
patrician, blue-blooded, something 
that reeked of tradition and anti-
semitism.  

JORDAN

Gentlemen, welcome to Stratton 
Oakmont.   The clients weve gone 
after in the past -- theyre done.  
We will now target exclusively the 
wealthiest one percent of 
Americans.  The methods weve used 
-- over.  Loud, obnoxious sales 
hype is worthless with these 
people.  

JORDAN (CONT'D)

In military terms its like carpet-
bombing -- noisy, menacing and 
only marginally effective.  As 
Stratton brokers you will be laser-
guided smart-bombs aimed at high-
priority targets.  You will 
establish an initial relationship 
with your clients selling only 
blue chip stocks -- then and only 
then will you attempt to sell the 
pink sheets, where the real money 
is.  Now the key to every sale is 
this:  

JORDAN (CONTD)

No one buys stock unless he thinks 
its going up and going up now.  
You must convince your client to 
buy before the takeover happens, 
before the lawsuit is settled, 
before the patent is granted.    
If he says Ill think about it and 
call you back, its over, youre 
dead!  No one calls back!  So you 
have to create urgency --  

JORDAN

--and once Kodak settles the 
lawsuit, institutions will be 
permitted to buy their shares in 
large blocks again.  And when that 
happens, which is any day now, 
what do you think will happen to 
the price of Kodak stock? 

Itll go up?

CLIENT  (O.S.)

JORDAN

Exactly.  Which is why you should 
pick up 5000 shares today, a 
$200,000 investment.  

Then you lower your voice.  

JORDAN

JORDAN 

Believe me, sir, you will not be 
sorry. 

JORDAN 

Then you wait.  Whoever speaks 
first loses.  At this point, where 
are we in the sale?  Chester?

About to close?

CHESTER MING

JORDAN

No, you sweet and sour douchebag!  
Were at the beginning of the 
beginning!  This is where the sale 
starts.  You as a salesman are 
almost hoping he says no so you 
can finally do your fucking job!

I dont know, I dont think so. 

CLIENT (O.S.)

JORDAN

He doesnt know, he needs to 
think, hes gotta ask his wife!  
The fact is it doesnt matter what  
the fuck he says!  If hes already 
agreed that the stocks going up, 
then the only real objection he 
has at this point is he doesnt 
trust you!  And he shouldnt trust 
you, youre a fucking salesman!  
So what do you say?

DONNIE 

Let me ask you this, sir -- had I 
been your broker for the past 
three to four years and made you 
money on a consistent basis, you 
probably wouldnt say you need to 
think about it, youd probably say 
pick me up three or four thousand 
shares, am I right?  

Maybe.  

CLIENT #2 (O.S.)

SEA OTTER

Wait a second.  You mean to tell 
me if I put you in Union Carbide 
at 7 and took you out at 32--

ROBBIE FEINBERG

If I put you in Texas Instruments 
at 11 and took you out at 47--

CHESTER MING

--Walmart at 16 and took you out 
at 95, you wouldnt say Chester  
pick me up 10,000 shares?  Cmon.

Well yeah, in that case I would.

CLIENT #3 (O.S.)

DONNIE 

So the problem is that I dont 
have the luxury of a track record.  
Sir, let me reintroduce myself to 
you.  My name is Donnie Azoff--

--Nicky Koskoff--

RUGRAT

Chester Ming--

CHESTER MING

PETER DEBLASIO
Peter DeBlasio from Stratton 
Oakmont in New York City--

TOBY WELCH

--and I plan on being the top 
broker in my firm this year.

SEA OTTER

So what about this?  We start   
small with 500 shares, a cash 
outlay of $20,000.  

KALIL

If the stock goes up 10%, will 
that make you a rich man?  Of 
course not.

KIMMIE BELZER

If if goes down 10%, will it make 
you a poor man?  No..

CHESTER MING

What this trade will do is serve 
as a benchmark for future 
business.  

PETER DEBLASIO

The downside is minimal and the 
upside is a long-term relationship 
with a broker on Wall Street who 
will consistently make you money.

JORDAN

Your only regret will be that I 
didnt call you six months ago.  

CLIENT #1 (O.S.)

(to Robbie Feinberg)

All right.

CLIENT #2 (O.S.)

(to Sea Otter)
Give me 300 shares.

CLIENT #3 (O.S.)

(to Peter DeBlasio)

1200 shares.

CLIENT #4 (O.S.)

(to Jordan)

Ill take 5000 shares. 

Everybody have a good week?        

JORDAN

Id like to read you something.  

(reads spread sheet)

JORDAN (CONTD)

Month end, March 1991!  $28.7 
million in gross commissions - all 
in Stratton issues. Not bad for 
penny stocks, huh boys? Not bad 
for dumpin penny stocks.

JORDAN (CONTD)

And to celebrate with a weekly act 
of debauchery, I have offered our 
lovely sales assistant Danielle 
Harrison ten thousand dollars to 
have her head shaved!

JORDAN (CONTD)

FYI, Danielle tells me shes using 
the money for breast implants!  Is 
this a great company or what?!!

JORDAN (V.O.)

Word spread throughout Wall  
Street -- I was becoming a legend. 
Forbes Magazine even called to do 
a profile on me... 

JORDAN (V.O.)
A total fucking hatchet job.

JORDAN

The Wolf of Wall Street.        

That conniving little twat! 

(reading)

TERESA

(on the bright side) 

Your hair looks good. 

JORDAN

Jordan Belfort, a twisted version 
of Robin Hood who takes from the 
rich and gives to himself and his  
merry band of brokers.   

TERESA 

Theres no such thing as bad 
publicity, sweetie.  

The hells all this?   

JORDAN

JANET

The Forbes article.  Theyre 
applying for jobs.

Mr. Belfort!  Over here!  Sir!

JOB APPLICANTS

JORDAN (V.O.)

Forbes had made me a superstar.  
Every day dozens of money-crazed 
kids beat a path to my door with 
resumes they hadnt even bothered 
to spellcheck.  

JORDAN (V.O.)

If we hired em, they dropped out 
of college overnight and blew 
whatever allowance they had on a 
new suit from our in-house tailor.  
The median age of our brokerage 
couldnt get served in the bar 
down the street.

JORDAN (V.O.)

Not this guy though -- what the 
fuck is he even doing here?  He 
read the Forbes article, too, but 
he already had a job.

JORDAN (V.O.) 

Within months, we doubled in size, 
moved to even bigger offices.  

JORDAN (V.O.)

It was a madhouse, a greed-fest, 
with equal parts cocaine, 
testosterone and body fluids.   

JORDAN  (V.O.)

I had to declare the office a fuck-
free zone between the hours of 9 
and 7, but even that didnt help.

JORDAN (V.O.)

Actually the madness started on 
our very first day, when one of 
our brokers, Ben Jenner, 
christened the elevator by  
getting a blowjob from a sales 
assistant. 

JORDAN (V.O.)
Her name was Pam and to her 
credit, she did have an amazing 
technique, with this wild twist 
and jerk motion.  

JORDAN (V.O.)

Eventually Ben married her, which 
was pretty amazing considering she 
blew every guy in the office.

JORDAN (V.O.)
He got depressed and killed 
himself three years later.

JORDAN (V.O.)

Anyway, in an attempt to maintain 
order, I hired my dad Max as 
defacto CFO and head of the 
Gestapo. 

JORDAN  (V.O.)

We called him Mad Max because of 
his hair-trigger temper, which 
could be set off by something as 
innocuous as a ringing telephone. 

MAX

Who the hell has the goddamn gall 
to call this house on a Tuesday 
evening!  Goddammit!

JORDAN (V.O.)

But then the weirdest thing would 
happen.  Though hed never been 
near England, hed pick up the 
phone and affect an ever-so-slight 
British accent.  

JORDAN (V.O.)

This was his other persona -- the 
super polite, ever-gracious Sir 
Max.

MAX
(into phone)

Hello?...  Yes, Gene, right-eo.  
Good-good then...  Cheerio.

JORDAN (V.O.)

It was absolutely bizarre.  Hed 
hang up...

MAX

(hangs up phone)

Goddamn fucking halfwit!

And become Mad Max all over again.

JORDAN (V.O.)

JORDAN 
What if he gets hurt?

ROBBIE

Hell be wearing a helmet.  Plus 
theyve got, like, superhuman 
strength anyway. 

DONNIE

I did hear you're not supposed to 
make direct eye contact.  If you 
look at them too long in their 
eyes they get freaked out - their 
wires cross.

JORDAN

I think theres a limit to how far 
we can go... I mean we can throw 
shit at him and - 

They have a lot of feelings. 

DONNIE

JORDAN

Theres a specific thing that 
theyll do - You can throw him at 
a dart board but if you want him 
to show his cock or -

Yes, thats what this guy does.

ROBBIE

Thats his gift.

RUGRAT

Can we also bowl with him?

ROBBIE

RUGRAT

His brother is actually the 
bowler. 

ROBBIE

They strap a skateboard to him and 
throw him down an alley. 

RUGRAT

Theyre ornery, too, the little 
pricks.  You gotta be careful.

JORDAN
Get some tranq darts.

A little straitjacket. 

DONNIE 

JORDAN

Whats the liability on something 
like this?

RUGRAT

That's a whole different thing.  I 
can get on the phone with some 
people. I can talk to the 
insurance company and tell them 
exactly what we're going to do. 
But I think we go back to the same 
plan - loophole - if we don't 
really consider them people I 
think we are in the clear.

DONNIE

I think we should keep one in the 
office because I think theyre 
good luck. 

JORDAN

Treat it like the fuckin' thing it 
is.  He's coming in. We're paying 
him for something. Treat him with 
respect. And you just shake his 
hand like you don't even think 
anything's wrong.

DONNIE

You just look like something else 
is going on. 

You dont look at his eyes.

RUGRAT

Say thank you for being here.

DONNIE

ROBBIE

You dont turn your back on him. 
Its a sign of disrespect.

DONNIE

If you want a cracker or something 
- Im gonna have some treats in my 
pocket. I want to be in a strip 
club with you guys. Literally pull 
out a brief case and have a little 
fuckin' guy pop out of there. You 
know how much fuckin' pussy you 
get? 

The point is get it out.

JORDAN

DONNIE

Get the jokes out now. Get the 
fuckin jokes out now. 

JORDAN

Youre gonna fuck it up. Purge all 
this shit right now.

Thats what Im saying - 

DONNIE

JORDAN

When he comes in the room, I want 
him to feel like a human being -

DONNIE

Business. Business. Its fuckin 
business, bro.

JORDAN

I want him to feel just like a 
normal human being. Cause you know 
- like one of us. One of us. 

DONNIE

Like hes an actual human being. 
One of us. 

JORDAN

Gobble, gobble we accept you, one 
of us! One of us!

One of us.

ALL

JANET

Your dads coming.  With the 
American Express bill.

Can you stop him?

JORDAN

Fuck you, you stop him.

JANET

MAX

$430,000 dollars in one month!!  
Four-hundred-and-thirty-thousand 
dollars in one month!!

JORDAN

Hello, Father. 

(Maxs expression 
doesnt budge)

Theyre business expenses. Just 
relax. 

MAX

If you bastards don't wipe those 
smug fucking looks off your faces, 
I swear to God I'm gonna wipe em 
off for you!

(back to Jordan)

Are you insane?

ROBBIE

Actually, Max, my portion of the 
bill is hardly anything, so Im on 
the same page as you --

MAX

Shut the fuck up, Feinberg, you 
only have a portion because of my 
son, you worthless twerp!

DONNIE 

(chuckles)

Twerp.

MAX

You zip it, too, Azoff, those 
boiling teeth of yours are hurting 
my fucking eyes!  

(turning to Jordan)

My own son!  From my very loins!  
What do you think this is?

JORDAN
Will you calm down --

MAX

You don't think there's any end in 
sight, do you?  It's all one giant 
party to you schmendricks!  

MAX (CONT'D)
(holds up AMEX bill)

$26,000 for one dinner!!

JORDAN
Donnie ordered sides.

Yeah, that was... Sorry.

DONNIE 

MAX
(glowering)

What is EJ Entertainment?  What is 
EJ Entertainment?!

JORDAN

(restraining a grin)

You tell me, Dad.

MAX

Its a goddamn prostitution ring 
is what it is!!

Doesnt the IRS allow for T&A?

DONNIE 

MAX

Its T&E and stop fucking with me!  
What kind of hookers take credit 
cards, anyway?! 

JORDAN (V.O.)

In Stratton parlance, there were 
three kinds of hookers.  There 
were blue chips, the top of the 
line.  Model material.  They were 
priced between $300 and $500 and 
made you wear a condom unless you 
gave them a hefty tip, which I 
always did.  

JORDAN (V.O.)
Then came NASDAQs, who were 
pretty, but not great, usually   
in the two to three hundred  
dollar range.

JORDAN (V.O.)

Finally there were pink sheets,  
skanks, the bottom of the barrel. 

JORDAN (V.O.)

They usually cost a hundred or 
less, and if you didn't wear a 
condom, you'd get a penicillin 
shot the next day and pray your 
dick didn't fall off.

JORDAN (V.O.)

Not that we didnt fuck them, too. 
Believe me, we did. 

Give us a minute, will you, guys?

JORDAN

MAX
Whats the matter?

JORDAN

Nothing, just... My backs been 
killing me.  Pain shooting down my 
leg.  Not to worry, itll pass.

What do the doctors say? 

MAX

JORDAN 

Doctors, what do they know? Im on 
like twenty different medications.  

(re: the Amex bill)

Look, I know it's hard for you to 
make sense of these expenses, but 
there's a method here, okay?

MAX

And you have to lead by example, 
is that it?

(Jordan nods)

Im tellin ya, kid, one of these 
days... one of these days the 
chickens are gonna come home to 
roost.

JORDAN

In order to keep these guys 
working, I gotta keep em 
spending.  I need to keep them 
chasing the dream. You flash some 
cash, they do the same. It keeps 
them motivated.  

MAX

Pissing away money? Thats what 
motivates you kids?  

JORDAN

I could afford to pay them more, 
but then they wouldn't need me as 
much.  And as long as they need me 
they'll always fear me. I know it 
sounds crazy.

Crazy?  This... is obscene.

MAX

JORDAN (V.O.) 

It was obscene -- in the normal 
world.  But who wanted to live 
there?

JORDAN (O.C.)

-- so enjoy yourselves, you all 
deserve a celebration.  Cept for 
Kimmie, shes lazy and she steals.  

(off laughter, Kimmie 
flips him the bird; 
he blows her a kiss)

But, everybody, keep this in mind.  

JORDAN (O.C.) (CONT'D)

As my friend Donnie Azoff says, 
If you wanna party with the boys, 
you gotta wake up with the men.  
Monday morning I want you all 
looking razor-sharp.  Cuz 
Strattons got a few things on the 
horizon, things thatre gonna take 
it right up into the fucking 
stratosphere!

Jor-dan!  Jor-dan!  Jor-dan!

CROWD

JORDAN (PRE-LAP)

Fuck Merrill Lynch, this way we 
become the underwriters.

Like an investment bank.

ROBBIE (PRE-LAP)

JORDAN

Exactly.  We do our own IPOs and 
we will print money.  

SEA OTTER

Eat like a bird, shit like an 
elephant, baby!

JORDAN

They can take their Harvard asses 
under our desks and suck our 
cocks.

(to Rugrat)

How soon can you get the paperwork 
filed?

RUGRAT 

(super-stoned)

Cant we talk about this Monday? 

Its a simple fucking question. 

JORDAN

RUGRAT

Except Im looking at three of you 
right now. 

ROBBIE

Weve got Arncliffe National, 
theyre looking to go public, 
weve got -- 

DONNIE 

(very luded)

Oh, oh, Steve... Steve...

What?

JORDAN

...Steve... M-m-madden...

DONNIE 

JORDAN (V.O.)

The quaalude was first synthesized  
in 1951 by an Indian doctor -- 
thats dot Indian, not feathers -- 
as a sedative, and was prescribed 
to stressed housewives with sleep 
disorders.  Pretty soon someone 
figured out that if you resisted 
the urge to sleep for fifteen 
minutes, you got a pretty kick-ass 
high from it.  Didnt take long 
for people to start abusing ludes, 
course, and in 1982 the U.S. 
Government Schedule Oned them, 
along with the rest of the world.  
Which meant there was only a 
finite amount of these things 
left.  No shit, you cant even 
find em anymore today.  You 
peoplere all shit outta luck.

JORDAN

(to Donnie)

Whatre you saying, buddy?

(to the others)

Shhhh... listen to him...

Ssshhhhoes... shhhoooess...

DONNIE 

Holy fuck. 

SEA OTTER

My nutsacks about to explode. 

RUGRAT

Someones gotta take that down.

ROBBIE

NAOMI (V.O.)

A lotta people would look at me 
and think: golddigger, shes out 
to land the richest husband she 
can.  But you see, I came from 
nothing.  Like, below the poverty 
line.  And when you come from 
nothing, being rich means never 
having to go back to that.

Jordan, hey.  

CRISTY 

(he smiles; Cristy 
picks up his intent)

Have you met my friend Naomi? 

Naomi.

JORDAN

NAOMI

You have an awesome house.  I 
dont think Ive ever been in a 
house like this.

JORDAN

You like it?  I just got it.  I 
guess its okay.  Six bedrooms, 
two hot-tubs, one off the master 
suite overlooking the water.  You 
like to jet-ski?

Hi.  Blair Hollingsworth.  

BLAIR

JORDAN

Youre telling me youve never jet-
skied in your life?!

Never.

NAOMI

BLAIR

Yknow, we really should hit it, 
theres two other parties were 
sposed to get to --

What?  You just got here.  Stay.

JORDAN

Jordan, Teresa needs your help.

HILDY 

With what?

JORDAN

HILDY 

I dunno, youll have to ask your 
wife what she wants.

Oh sweet Jesus!

DONNIE(O.S.)

HILDY 

Donnie!  What the fuck are you 
doing?!

JORDAN (V.O.)

The day I met Naomi was the day  I 
truly became the Wolf.  Every guy 
wanted her -- so I had to have 
her.

JORDAN

Bay Ridge.  Thats near Staten 
Island?

NAOMI

Brooklyn, across the Verrazano 
Bridge.  Guinea gulch.  Ever been? 

Youre Italian?  

JORDAN

NAOMI

My dads side.  Also Dutch, 
German, English -- Im a mutt.  
Actually I have family over there, 
in London.  My Aunt Emma.  

That explains it then. 

JORDAN 

What?

NAOMI

JORDAN

(smiles)

Youre a Duchess.  The Duchess of 
Bay Ridge.

Could I have a straw please?

NAOMI

NAOMI (CONTD)

So I was a little surprised you 
asked Cristy for my number.  

How come?

JORDAN

NAOMI
Arent you married?

Married people cant have friends?

JORDAN

So I dont stain my teeth.

NAOMI 

--then at night I do my designs.  

NAOMI (O.S.)

NAOMI

An entire line of lingerie -- 
camisoles, bustiers, panties. 

JORDAN (V.O.)

She designs panties?!  Jesus 
fucking Christ!

JORDAN

Sounds like something I might 
invest in.  Venture capital.

NAOMI

Well we should definitely keep in 
touch, then.

Absolutely.

JORDAN

Thats me.  

NAOMI

JORDAN (V.O.)

Think, Jordan, think!  How can you 
get up to her apartment?!

You wanna come up for some tea?

NAOMI

Say hi, Rocky.

NAOMI

NAOMI (CONTD)

Why dont you light a fire?  Ill 
be right out.

JORDAN (V.O.)

God, please help me.  How can I 
fuck this girl?

JORDAN (V.O.)

Thats it, youre leaving.  Youre 
going home to your wife.

JORDAN (V.O.)

As you can probably guess, I 
fucked her goddamn brains out.  

For eleven seconds.

JORDAN (V.O.)

Im sorry, I--

Did you cum?  

JORDAN

NAOMI

JORDAN
(nods; gasping)

Yeah, but Im still hard.

JORDAN (V.O.) (CONTD)

Being inside her... was like your 
cock went to heaven and God 
himself was cupping your balls.

I couldnt get enough.  

JORDAN (V.O.)

JORDAN (V.O.)

Every chance we got, wed sneak 
off together...

Hold still, dont move.

JORDAN

(to the Driver)

Watch the potholes!

TERESA (O.S.)
Get out of the fucking car.

JORDAN

JORDAN 

I thought you were at the beach 
house, I--

TERESA 

I married you when you had  
nothing-- 

JORDAN

Teresa... I dont know what to 
say. 

TERESA

Youre like a totally different 
person. 

JORDAN

Im not.  Im sorry.  I made a 
mistake, okay?

Tell me you dont love her.  

TERESA

I...  

JORDAN

TERESA

(off his silence)

Jordan?

I felt horrible. 

JORDAN (V.O.) 

JORDAN (V.O.)

Three days later I filed for 
divorce and moved Naomi into the 
apartment. 

JORDAN (V.O.)

Say what you will, but the Duchess   
did have style.  She brought in a 
decorator, feng shuid the place--            
she even hired a gay butler.  

JORDAN
Thank you, Nicholas.

JORDAN (V.O.) (CONTD)

He was smart, sophisticated, 
really great.  Except for that  
one time... 

Omigod!

NAOMI

NAOMI

He must have thought I was at my 
mothers. 

Where were they?  In the bedroom?

JORDAN

They were right here!

NAOMI

NAOMI (CONTD)

It gets worse.  After I chased 
them out, I checked the apartment.  

JORDAN (V.O.)

The motherfucker stole fifty grand 
in cash and jewelry.

I just want my stuff back, okay?

JORDAN

I didnt take anything.

NICHOLAS THE BUTLER

DONNIE 

(in his face)

I should kill you, cocksucker!  
You do not fuck with this man!

JORDAN

You were high, things got out of 
control, I get it.  Believe me I 
do, I have a Phd in debauchery.   

I didnt do it. 

NICHOLAS THE BUTLER

DONNIE 

Ill knock your fuckin teeth out, 
motherfucker!

JORDAN

Just give me the money, give me 
the jewelry, and well forget the 
whole thing. 

Its because Im gay, isnt it?

NICHOLAS THE BUTLER

JORDAN

Nicholas.  You could fuck a baby 
sheep as far as I care, on my 
brand new fucking sofa.  What I 
wont stand for is being robbed.  

Im telling you the truth.

NICHOLAS THE BUTLER

Ill ask you one last time.

JORDAN

Youre dead, you piece of shit!

DONNIE 

Jordan, please.

NICHOLAS THE BUTLER

Fine. 

JORDAN

JORDAN  (V.O.) (CONTD)

Its amazing the kind of loyalty 
money will buy.  I mean Chester 
almost killed this prick. 

JORDAN (V.O.)

I finally called the cops, mainly 
to save Nicholass life. 

JORDAN (V.O.)

I gave them each a thousand bucks 
and told them what Nicholas had 
done.  Then they kicked his ass.

COP #1

JORDAN  (V.O.)

Loyalty, like I said.  Which was 
the key component to my incredible 
fucking success. 

JORDAN (V.O.)

Besides Brad, I had eight other 
ratholes, close friends whod 
own stock on paper, but kick the 
profits back to me after I drove 
the price through the roof. 

JORDAN (V.O.)

The SEC knew I was doing something 
shady, but they couldnt figure 
out what the fuck it was. 

MANNY RISKIN 

Im telling you -- piss on the 
SECs leg, youll end up with your 
tits in a ringer.

JORDAN (V.O.)

My securities attorney, Manny 
Riskin.  Seven hundred an hour to 
be the voice of doom. 

JORDAN

Its under control.  Will you 
relax already?

MAX

What the fuck is this imbecile 
doing?!

JORDAN (V.O.) 

The SEC sent two lawyers down to 
review our files, so I set them  
up in our conference room.

JORDAN (V.O.)

Then I had it bugged and the air 
conditioning locked till it felt 
like Antarctica in there.  

JORDAN (V.O.)

So here they were, looking for a 
smoking gun while I was firing a 
bazooka right under their noses.  
It was our first IPO, and we were 
driving the stock price to the 
fucking moon. 

Arncliffe National, its on fire! 

BROKER #1

BROKER #2

(voice lowered)

Believe me, your grandkids will 
thank you.

BROKER #3

(to Sales Assistant)

Arncliffe National, ten thousand 
shares!

JORDAN 

See an IPO is an initial public 
offering, the first time a stock 
is offered for sale to the general 
population.  

JORDAN  (CONT'D)
As the firm taking the company 
public, we set the initial price, 
then sold those shares back to --  

(stops; then)

You know what, youre probably not 
following what Im saying.  The 
question is, was it legal? 
Absolutely not. But we were making 
more money that we knew what to do 
with. 

But I figured it out.  

JORDAN (V.O.)  

Omigod!!

NAOMI (O.C.)

JORDAN (V.O.)

I held my bachelor party at the 
Tangiers in Las Vegas -- one last 
blowout for the Gods before I 
settled down for good.  

JORDAN (V.O.)

A hundred Strattonites flew in 
with fifty hookers and enough 
drugs to open a pharmacy.

JORDAN (V.O.)

All told, the weekend cost me 
almost two million dollars--

JORDAN (V.O.)

But the wedding was like something 
out of a fairy tale--

JORDAN (V.O.)

--with Naomi my Duchess, me her 
handsome Duke and The Bahamas 
Ocean Club our castle. 

JORDAN (V.O.)

Of course after that bachelor 
party, the Duke needed a few 
penicillin shots so he could 
safely consummate the marriage.

BARRY KLEINMAN

Im Barry Kleinman, filming the 
wedding -- would you like to say 
something to Jordan and Naomi?

Good luck!  We love you!

RUGRAT / ABBY

NAOMI
Omigod!  Aunt Emma!

Jordan!  Look!

NAOMI (CONTD)

Jordan dear, how lovely.  

AUNT EMMA

Its so nice to see you again. 

JORDAN

AUNT EMMA 
Into the donuts, I see. 

Oh, Im--- uh...

JORDAN

AUNT EMMA

I lived through the 60s, my dear.  
Enjoy the day.  

Careful now.  You ready?

JORDAN

What is this?

NAOMI

JORDAN

Your wedding present.  Check out 
the name.

JORDAN (V.O.)

For three weeks we sailed the 
Naomi through the Caribbean--

JORDAN (V.O.)

--eventually taking her home to 
Long Island, where wed bought a 
house.

JORDAN (V.O.)

Seven acres on the Gold Coast of 
Long Island--

JORDAN (V.O.)

--the most expensive real estate 
in the world, with maids, cooks, 
landscapers, you name it.  

JORDAN (V.O.)

We even had two guards who worked 
in shifts, both named Rocco.  

It  was heaven on earth.

JORDAN (V.O.)

Wake up, you bag of shit!

NAOMI

The fuck are you doing?! 

JORDAN

Whos Venice?

What?!

NAOMI

JORDAN

NAOMI

Who is she?!  Some little hooker 
you fucked last night?

What?  No!  Naomi!

JORDAN

Venice, where are you? 

JORDAN

NAOMI

You were calling her name in your 
sleep!

I can explain everything.

JORDAN

NAOMI

Go ahead.  More lies from the man 
who lies for a living!

JORDAN 

No, really.  Donnie and me, were 
investing in a condo development 
in Venice.  

Italy?!

NAOMI

California, baby.

JORDAN

Yeah, right.

NAOMI

Duchess, come on.  

JORDAN

NAOMI

Dont Duchess me, you scumbag.  
You think I dont know what youre 
up to?  Youre a father now and 
you act like an infant!

Fuck. Naomi!  Why are you so mad? 

JORDAN

NAOMI

Where do you want me to start?  
How about you flying in here on 
your stupid helicopter at three in 
the morning waking up Skylar?! 

NAOMI (O.S.)

Does it even matter to you that I 
just had that driving range sodded 
with Bermuda grass? 

NAOMI

But why should you give a shit? 
You're not the one who researched 
the fucking thing and dealt with 
the fucking golf course people!  

JORDAN

Youre an aspiring landscape 
architect?!  But what happened to 
wine connoisseur?  Oh wait, that 
was last month!

Fuck you!  

NAOMI

NAOMI (CONTD)

Stop flexing your arms, you look 
like a fucking imbecile.

(re: his crotch)

And dont think that impresses me 
much.

JORDAN

I wasn't flexing my arms.  You're 
just lucky to have a husband who's 
in such great shape.  Now get over 
here and kiss me!

Kiss you?!

NAOMI

JORDAN

Where the fuck were you last 
night?

JORDAN (V.O.)

My morning ritual.  First Id get 
up and fight with Naomi about 
whatever I did the night before. 

JORDAN (V.O.)

Next it was a steam so I could 
sweat out whatever drugs were 
still in my system.

After that Id assess the damage.

JORDAN (V.O.)

JORDAN (V.O.)

What kind of maniac abuses eye 
drops? 

JORDAN (V.O.)

Then Id get dressed, take my 
back pills to get me started, 
then attempt to make up with her.

Hey, Skylar.  

JORDAN

NAOMI

(little girl voice)

Good morning Daddy.  Wheres my 
kiss?

JORDAN
(playing along)

Does Daddy get to kiss both his 
girls?

NAOMI

Ohhh, no!  Daddy doesn't even get  
to touch Mommy for a very, very 
long time.  

JORDAN

Cmon, Nay, please.  You know how 
sorry I am.  I swear I--

NAOMI

(cutting him off)

Daddy shouldnt waste his time.  
And from now on it's going to be 
nothing but short, short skirts 
around the house!  And Mommys    
so sick and tired of wearing 
panties, uhhh.  In fact shes 
decided to throw them all away.

(parting her thighs)

So take a good look.  Youll be 
seeing an awful lot of it around 
the house, but no touching.  

Whats wrong, Daddy?

NAOMI (CONTD)

JORDAN

Cmon, why are you doing this?    
I said Im sorry.

NAOMI

(pouting)

Ohhhh poor, poor Dada. He loves to 
say how wrong he is when hes 
ready to come in his own pants. 
Isnt that right Dada? Mommy loves 
Daddy so, so much and theres 
nothing she wants to do more right 
now than to make love to Daddy all 
day long. Well, I guess its time 
for Daddy to be taught his first 
lesson.  

JORDAN

I wouldnt do that if I were you 
Mommy. I think Mommy should hear a 
story before she decides to please 
herself like that.
Can Daddy tell Mommy a story?

(off her nod)

And does mommy promise to keep her 
legs spread wide, wide open the 
whole time?

(she nods dreamily)

Good.  Once upon a time there was 
a great big mansion in Long Island 
and the people who lived there had 
lots and lots of money.  But of 
all the possessions they had, 
there was one thing that was much 
more valuable than all the rest 
combined, and that was their 
little baby daughter.  

JORDAN (CONTD)

Now because he was very security-
conscious, the Daddy hired two 
full-time guards, big hairy men 
both named Rocco, and they 
installed security cameras all 
around the house.  And one of 
those cameras is right over 
Daddy's shoulder.

JORDAN (CONTD)

So smile, Mommy!  You're on Candid 
Camera!

You asshole!  

NAOMI

JORDAN (V.O.)

The good thing about living with  
a world-class ballbreaker is they 
make all the other ballbreakers in 
your life a little easier to take. 

There he is.

DONNIE 

JORDAN

(a quick hug; then)

Steve here yet?   

On his way.  Very excited.

DONNIE

Good.  Cuz we have a problem.

JORDAN

JANET
(incredulous)

Is he wearing a bow tie?

JORDAN

Hes got nothing better to do on 
the day of the biggest IPO in this 
firms history?!  

The fuck you doing?

DONNIE 

BROKER IN A BOWTIE

(bewildered)

Cleaning my fishbowl.  

Oh.  

DONNIE 

DONNIE(CONTD)

On new issue day?!  On 
cocksucking, motherfucking      
new issue day?!

DONNIE(CONTD)

This is what happens when you fuck 
with your pets on new issue day!

DONNIE(CONTD)

Now take your bowtie, get your 
shit and get the fuck out! 

The Cobbler.  Ready to get rich?  

JORDAN

Hey buddy.

STEVE MADDEN

JORDAN (V.O.)

Steve Madden, the shoe designer, 
was a childhood friend of 
Donnies, but I didnt hold that 
against him.  Remember those ads, 
those giant-headed girls with bug 
eyes wearing those big clunky 
shoes?  

JORDAN (V.O.)

He came to me a few years earlier 
when he was just starting out, so 
I became a silent partner in his 
company, buying an 85% stake for 
only a million bucks.  

JORDAN (V.O.)

The company blew up and we were 
now taking it public.  It was the 
biggest deal wed ever done and 
the hottest IPO on Wall Street. 

DONNIE

--which is why they need to meet 
you.  

JORDAN

You gotta get em fired up so 
theyll push the shit out of this 
stock.   

Let them feel your passion.

DONNIE

STEVE MADDEN

(into mic)

Uhhh... excuse me... 

STEVE MADDEN (CONTD)

For those of you who don't know 
me, my name is Steve Madden. I'm --

We know who you are!  

ONE BROKER

STEVE MADDEN 

I uh, I'd like to start by telling 
you about my background in the 
shoe industry.  

Nice fucking hat!

ANOTHER BROKER

STEVE MADDEN

I uh... first started working in 
the shoe industry, in a shoe 
store.  When I was sixteen, my 
friends were out chasing girls, 
but I was learning about women's 
shoes. 

KALIL

STEVE MADDEN (CONTD)

Sorry...  Anyway, my first job  
was at a shoe store like I said 
where I worked in the stockroom.  
You know, I can honestly say Ive 
been a lover of women's shoes 
since I was twelve--

Freak!

BROKER #4

STEVE MADDEN

No.  Heh-heh.  Not like that.      
I mean somehow I became fascinated 
with the endless design 
possibilities for women's shoes--

BROKER #5

STEVE MADDEN (CONTD)

This shoe -- the Mary Lou -- is 
the one that really put me on the 
map.  Its a black patent leather  
variation of the Mary Jane, but--

JORDAN

All right, let's hear it for Steve 
Madden and the wonderful Mary Lou!

JORDAN (CONTD)

Okay, now that you got that out  
of your system, I want you to know 
why Steve is so completely off the 
fucking wall... Its because this 
man is a creative genius.  Steve's 
power, his gift -- is that he 
creates trends.  Artists like 
Steve come along once a century!  
Elvis!  Andy Warhol!   Giorgio 
Armani!  Who knows how high this 
stock could go?  The 20s?  The 
50s?  The 80s?

JORDAN (CONTD)

I want everybody to look down.   
See that little black box in front 
of you?  It's called a telephone. 
Now I'm gonna let you in on a 
little secret about this  
telephone -- it won't dial itself!  
Thats right -- until you take 
some action, it's nothing more 
than a worthless hunk of plastic, 
like a loaded M16 without a 
trained Marine to pull the 
trigger.  And in the case of the 
telephone, it's the action of you, 
a highly trained Strattonite, a 
killer who will not take no for an 
answer!   A person who will not 
hang up the phone until his client 
either buys or fucking dies!  

JORDAN (CONTD)

I don't care if you graduated from 
Harvard or Bumfuck University or 
never got past fourth fucking 
grade!  That phone is the great 
equalizer! 

(pause; looks around)

There is no nobility in poverty. 
I've been rich, and I've been poor  
and I choose rich every time. 

JORDAN (CONTD)

At least as a rich man, when I 
have to face my problems, I show 
up in the back of a limo wearing a 
$2000 suit and $40,000 gold watch! 

JORDAN (CONTD)
And if anyone here thinks I'm 
crazy, get the fuck out and get a 
job at McDonalds, because that's 
where you fucking belong! But 
before you depart this room full 
of winners, I want you to take a 
good look at the person next to 
you, because one day in the not-so-
distant future, you'll be sitting 
at a red light in your beat-up old 
Pinto, and that persons gonna 
pull up in a brand new Porsche, 
with their gorgeous young wife at 
their side. And who will you be 
next to?  Some ugly beast with 
three days of razor-stubble in a 
sleeveless moo-moo, crammed in 
next to you with a carload of 
groceries from the fucking Price 
Club!

JORDAN (CONTD)

So you listen to me and listen 
carefully.  Are you behind on your 
credit card bills?  Good.  Pick up 
the phone and start dialing.  Is 
your landlord threatening to evict 
you?  Good.  Pick up the phone and 
start dialing.  Does your 
girlfriend think you're a fucking 
loser?  Pick up the phone and 
start fucking dialing!  I want  
you to deal with your problems by 
becoming rich!  I want you to go 
out and spend money!  Leverage 
yourself, back yourself into a 
corner, let the consequences of 
failure become so fucking 
unthinkable that you'll have no 
choice but to do whatever it takes 
to win!  

JORDAN (CONTD)
You have an obligation here, 
people!  To your clients!  To this 
firm!  An obligation to yourself, 
godammit!  You ram Steve Madden 
stock down your clients throats   
and make them choke on it till 
they buy 20,000 shares!  Be 
aggressive!  Be ferocious!  Be 
telephone fucking terrorists!!  

JORDAN (V.O.) (CONTD)

At 1 p.m. we opened the stock for 
sale at $4.50 a share.  By 1:03   
it was over eighteen dollars.

SEA OTTER

JORDAN (V.O.) 

Of course I couldnt have done 
this without help.  Id leaked the 
word on Wall Street that Stratton 
was a buyer up until twenty.  So 
not only were we pushing Madden, 
all the big firms were too.

JORDAN (V.O.)

As long as they knew Id buy the 
shares back at the top of the 
market, theyd drive the price   
up as high as I fucking wanted.

JORDAN

Of the two million shares being 
offered for sale, a million 
belonged to me, held in phony 
accounts by my ratholes.  Once the 
price hit the high teens, I-- 

JORDAN (CONTD)

Like I said before, who gives a 
shit?  As always, the point is 
this-- 

22 million in three fucking hours! 

DONNIE

Janet, baby.  Drink.  

JORDAN

JANET

Call for you.  Barry Kleinman from 
Future Video?

Who?

JORDAN

JANET

He filmed your wedding.  He says 
its urgent.

Barry?

JORDAN

BARRY KLEINMAN

Jordan, hey.  Listen, I got a 
subpoena.  The FBI wants a copy  
of your wedding video.  

The F-B-fucking-I?

JORDAN (V.O.)

BO DIETL  (V.O.)

Names Denham, hes an agent in 
the New York office.

Whats his problem?

JORDAN (V.O.)

BO DIETL (V.O.)

Hes a boy scout, thinks youre 
Gordon Gekko. 

But my goddamn wedding video?

JORDAN

BO DIETL

Got your whole inner circle in one 
place, faces and names. Hes 
hoping it rattles you, or maybe 
your wife, so that she starts 
nagging you to turn witness. 

JORDAN

(thats laughable)

What? He wants me to rat on 
myself?

BO DIETL

(shrugs)

Good news is I made some calls, 
DEA, Justice?  No one but him even 
knows who you are. 

JORDAN

Can you bug him or something, tap 
his phone?

BO DIETL

Jordan, relax.  First off, you 
dont fuck with these guys, not 
that way.  Secondly, I got a P.I. 
license, you know?

JORDAN

Maybe I should call him, see what 
he wants.  

BO DIETL

No! Anybody does that should be 
your lawyer. What you do is eat 
your dinner, drink your drink, and 
forget about it. Cuz as far as I 
hear he doesnt have shit.  

JORDAN (O.S.)
Patrick? Hey! Cmon aboard!

Planks right down there.

JORDAN (CONTD)

AGENT DENHAM

Mr. Belfort, Im Agent Denham.  
This is Agent Hughes.

JORDAN

Heya! This is Nicole and, 
um...Heidi. Girls, Patrick and...? 

AGENT DENHAM

Agents Denham and Hughes. Your 
message said you wanted to speak 
privately. 

It did. I do.

(off Denhams stare)
Oh, theyre just friends.

JORDAN 

(to the girls)

Give us a minute, okay?

JORDAN (CONTD)

Can I get a glass? Got wine open 
or any kinda booze. Shrimp and 
lobsterre over there if youre 
hungry.

AGENT DENHAM

Bureau forbids us from drinking at 
sea.

JORDAN

I have something for you, I just 
gotta find it. Have a seat, will 
ya? Ever been on one of these 
before?

AGENT DENHAM

A boat? Learned to sail when I was 
six.

JORDAN

I mean, one like this. Just had 
her extended to put a chopper on 
the back.

AGENT DENHAM

Never been on a boat with a second 
mode of transportation on top of 
it. 

AGENT DENHAM (CONTD)

(before hell accept)

What is this?

JORDAN

Names and addresses of every guest 
at my wedding. Friends, clients. I 
even threw in the seating chart. 
Heard thats why you wanted the 
video, figured thisd expedite 
whatever it is youre doing.

(Denham looks: its 
indeed a guest list 
from the wedding)

I wanted to show you Ive got 
nothing to hide. I know youre 
investigating Stratton but for the 
life of me I cant figure out why. 
Sure, my company is unorthodox; 
what brokerage isnt? Maybe were 
a little louder than most but we 
dont do anything illegal. Talk to 
the SEC, theyll tell you, they 
checked us out up and down.

AGENT DENHAM
The SECs actually a civil 
regulatory agency. We pursue 
criminal activity.

JORDAN

Thats what Im saying. You guys 
take on real crime. Which is why 
Im so curious: what do you think 
we did?

AGENT DENHAM

I cant discuss ongoing 
investigations. 

I understand.

JORDAN

AGENT DENHAM

Though, to be frank, this case 
kinda got dumped on my desk. Some 
higher-up felt your shop needed 
looking into after all that press, 
fell on me to do the looking. 

JORDAN

You know who you should be looking 
at? Goldman, Lehman Brothers, 
Merrill. 

JORDAN (CONT'D)
What those guysre up to with 
collateralized debt obligations? 
This internet stock bullshit? 
Cmon. If you want, Ill walk you 
through exactly --

AGENT DENHAM

-- thatd be great. And if theres 
anything you can give me just to 
close out your file, get it off my 
desk--

JORDAN

-- sure, get you back to the real 
criminals --

AGENT DENHAM

-- then we could both profit from 
this little sit-down.

JORDAN

You sure you dont want anything 
to drink? Water for your pal?

(Denham demurs)

Rumor is your started out in 
finance. Even got your brokers 
license before you joined the 
bureau.

Who told you that?

AGENT DENHAM

JORDAN

(searches his memory)

Jeez, who was it...?

(comes up short)

Ever regret it? Giving up the 
money-crazed, pin-striped life? 
Ever think where youd be if youd 
stuck with it?

AGENT DENHAM 

When Im riding the subway home, 
sweating my balls off, in a suit 
Ive worn three days, sure.

JORDAN

Whattaya pull in working at the 
bureau, if you dont mind me 
asking. 50-60K a year?

AGENT DENHAM

Just about. We get a free handgun 
out of it, though, that doesnt 
suck.

JORDAN

Scrazy, the world we live in, the 
jobs with real value, the ones we 
should appreciate -- firefighters, 
teachers, FBI agents -- those are 
the ones we pay the least.

Way of the world. 

AGENT DENHAM 

JORDAN

Thats one thing I like about what 
I do, the opportunity to make that 
right. Take this kid we had 
interning last year. Didnt want 
to be a broker, wanted to be an 
environmental scientist or 
something, he had a student loan 
debts up to his eyeballs. Anyway, 
his mom gets sick, all they can 
afford is third-rate care. Some of 
us got together, made an 
investment on his behalf and -- 
boom -- overnight everything 
changes, shes seeing the best 
doctors in the country. Sadly, 
didnt work out, she passed but 
still: having the power to do that 
makes all the other bullshit worth 
while.

(as Denham considers 
that)

See, its all about proper 
guidance, Pat. Knowing someone 
with the right relationships, 
whos discreet. I can change a 
life almost every day.

AGENT DENHAM

How much that intern make off your 
deal?

North of half a million.

JORDAN

AGENT DENHAM

Can you say that again, what you 
told me?

(Jordan declines with 
a smile; to Agent 
Hughes)

I believe Mr. Belfort just tried 
to bribe a federal officer.

What? I was making conversation.

JORDAN

Sounds like that to me, Jordan.

AGENT DENHAM

...no, no, no...

JORDAN

...sounded like that...

AGENT DENHAM

JORDAN

...no, to constitute a bribe, 
dont I have to make an explicit 
offer of money for services? With 
an exact dollar figure attached? 
All I said was north of half a 
million. According to the U.S. 
Criminal Code, that dog wont 
hunt, Pat.

(then)

Heard you were a straight arrow. 
That you wouldnt bend the rules 
other agents might. He was right.

You did a background check on me?

AGENT DENHAM

JORDAN

Figured you were looking into me, 
was only fair. Plus you sail on a 
yacht fit for a Bond villain, 
sometimes you gotta act the part. 

AGENT DENHAM

This is why you invited me down to 
your yacht? With a couple hookers 
on it --

-- those are friends --

JORDAN

AGENT DENHAM

-- to get a sense of the guy who 
was coming after you?

JORDAN

Thanks for coming down. Now get 
off my boat.

AGENT DENHAM

You know, most of the Wall Street 
jackasses I bust, they were born 
to the life. 

AGENT DENHAM (CONT'D)

Their father was a douchebag 
before them, and his father before 
that. But you, you got this way 
all on your own. Good for you, 
Jordan.

(as he starts to go)

Thank you for having us. Im 
absolutely certain well see each 
other again.

(before he does)

You know, this is about the nicest 
boat Ive ever been on. Just think 
what a hero Ill be in the office 
when the bureau seizes it. 

JORDAN

Hey, Denham! Im gonna eat a claw 
of lobster now as I get my cock 
sucked by Heidi down below. You 
have a super ride home on the 
subway thinking about that!

JORDAN (V.O.)

He was a numbers guy, a follow-the-
fucking-moneyer.  He wasnt gonna 
come at me through my guys, 
looking for a weak link and a 
quick kill.  He was gonna come at 
me like an accountant would, the 
way Ness got Capone, through my 
books.  Which meant?  It was ass-
covering time.

NAOMI

Switzerland?  What the fuck is in 
Switzerland?

JORDAN

Swiss cheese, Naomi, what do you 
fucking think?

JORDAN (V.O.)

Rugrat set up a meeting with a 
Swiss Banker he knew from law 
school who could launder our 
money, but it wasnt till noon  
the next day.

JORDAN (V.O.)

I knew if I timed my lude intake 
right, Id sleep through the 
entire overnight flight.

JORDAN (V.O.)

At four p.m. I popped a few ludes, 
which started kicking in by the 
time I finished our sales meeting.  
This was the tingle phase.    

JORDAN   (V.O.)

By dinner I popped a few more on 
top of some cocktails and an 
valium or two.  The slur phase. 

JORDAN (V.O.)

By eight thirty Id done a few 
more and pretty much lost my motor 
skills.  This was the drool phase. 

JORDAN  (V.O.)

And by ten I didnt know who or 
what I was doing -- the amnesia 
phase.  We boarded the plane just 
before midnight.

JORDAN

(to a Stewardess)

Sweetheart!  Look at you!

Donnie.  Donnie, wake up.

JORDAN 

Nuuhh?

DONNIE

JORDAN

Untie me, shitbag.  You think this 
is funny?

DONNIE

I didnt tie you, the captain did.  
He almost tasered you.  

Why?

JORDAN

JORDAN  (V.O.)

This was fucking great.  I hadnt 
laundered a dime yet and already  
I was under arrest.  

JORDAN (V.O.)

Worse yet was the plastic baggie 
of ludes that Donnied stuffed up 
his ass.

JORDAN (V.O.)

But before he could even get a 
hemorrhoid--

JORDAN (V.O.) 

--the whole thing was quashed by 
our friend the Swiss banker. Which 
was lucky for me, since so far Id 
been able to keep Agent Fuckface 
unaware of the trip.

SAUREL

Jordan Belfort!  At last!  
Nicholas has told me so much.

Jordan, Jean-Jacques Saurel.

RUGRAT

JORDAN

Nice to make your acquaintance.  
This is some lobby you got.

SAUREL 

Ah, yes.  We gave our designer an 
unlimited budget and he exceeded 
it.  Come!  You must tell me all 
about your adventure with the 
stewardess over coffee!

DONNIE

We have a joke in America.  
Heaven is a place where the 
police are Brits, the chefs are 
Italian, the car mechanics are 
German, the prostitutes are French 
and the bankers are Swiss.  I 
never got it til now -- look at 
those fucking fish!  Come here, 
little guy...

SAUREL

Yes, we have the same joke here.  
Only sometimes the English are 
chauffeurs and the chefs are 
French.  The Germans, alas, are 
always mechanics; no one wants to 
grant them more authority than 
that.

JORDAN

I'm curious about your bank 
secrecy laws.

SAUREL

Excusez-moi, Jordan, Swiss custom 
requires ten minutes of idle chit-
chat before business can be 
discussed.

(a smile)

Of course, lets get down to it.  
What would you like to know?

JORDAN

Under what circumstances would you 
be obligated to cooperate with an 
FBI or U.S. Justice Department 
investigation?

Ca depend.

SAUREL

Ca depend?  Ca depend on what?

JORDAN

SAUREL

Whether America plans to invade 
Switzerland in the coming months.

RUGRAT

Want me to see if tanks are 
rolling down the Rue de la Croix?

JORDAN  (V.O.)

What Im asking, you Swiss dick, 
is are you going to fuck me over.

SAUREL  (V.O.)
I understand perfectly, you 
American shitheel.

SAUREL

The only way the Banque Real de 
Geneve would cooperate with a 
foreign legal body is if the crime 
being pursued also happened to be 
a crime in Switzerland.  But there 
are very few Swiss laws pertaining 
to your rumored improprieties.  
Which is why Mr. Azoffs joke is 
most appropriate: from a financial 
standpoint you are now in heaven, 
and we welcome you.  If the U.S. 
Justice Department or FBI or SEC 
or IRS sent us a subpoena, it 
would become papier-toillette.  We 
would wipe our ass with it. 

JORDAN 

Unless it was an investigation 
into stock fraud -- which is a 
crime in Switzerland.  Then youd 
have to cooperate.

SAUREL

(now hes impressed)

Yes, we would.  Assuming the 
account is under your name.  
However, if it were in the name of 
a nominee of yours...

JORDAN  (V.O.)

Was that yodeling I just heard or 
did you just say what I thought 
you said?  

Yes!  Yes! 

SAUREL (V.O.)

JORDAN (V.O.)
He was telling me to use a 
rathole.  Problem was: sneaking a 
U.S. rathole into Switzerland was 
a chance I couldnt take.  What I 
needed was somebody with a 
European passport.

Jordan?

AUNT EMMA

JORDAN

(big smile, sweating)

Surprise.

AUNT EMMA

So tell me about this plan of 
yours. 

JORDAN

Id like us to go to Switzerland 
tomorrow so you can open an 
account.  Ill fund it, and Ill 
pay you really well for your 
trouble.  

Oh my. 

AUNT EMMA

JORDAN

Next month maybe you can fly to 
New York and we can start moving 
the cash.

AUNT EMMA

Moving the cash.

(smiles)

I feel like a character in an   
Ian Fleming novel.  Its all quite 
racy, isnt it?

JORDAN

It is, and its illegal too.  Of 
course if you ever got in trouble, 
Id come forward in two seconds, 
say I duped you, but even still. 

AUNT EMMA

Risk is what keeps us young, isnt 
it darling?  

JORDAN

I like that attitude. Promise me 
youll spend at least ten thousand 
pounds per month out of the 
account, okay?

AUNT EMMA

(chuckles)

I wouldn't even know how.  I 
really do have everything I need.  

JORDAN

But I bet you don't have 
everything you want.  How about a 
bigger apartment so your grandkids 
can sleep over? 

Shall we sit?

AUNT EMMA

Sure, thatd be great.  

JORDAN

AUNT EMMA

Sometimes I wonder if you let 
money get the best of you, dear.  

(beat)

Among other substances.

Its that obvious, huh?

JORDAN

AUNT EMMA

Its the height of summer and 
youve got the chills.  

JORDAN

Im a drug addict, Emma. Coke, 
pills, you name it, whatever you 
got. Sex addict too. 

AUNT EMMA

(laughs)

Well there are worse things to be 
addicted to than sex. 

JORDAN

(chuckles; then)

Why did I just tell you that?

AUNT EMMA

(playful)

Because Im very easy to talk to.  

JORDAN

As a matter of fact you are. My 
job, you know, its tough. I mean 
Im not complaining, its just the 
stress. All these people depending 
on me. Millions of dollars at 
stake every day. I sometimes feel 
Ive bitten off more than I can 
chew.

Youre a man with large appetites. 

AUNT EMMA

Is she fucking hitting on me?

JORDAN (V.O.)

JORDAN

I agree. I put it on myself. Its 
hard to control the anxiety, you 
know? Its hard to learn to relax.

To release the tension.  

AUNT EMMA

She is hitting on me!  Holy shit!

JORDAN (V.O.)

JORDAN

Exactly, to release the tension. 
Sometimes you gotta learn to do 
what comes natural in life, huh?  

Is he fucking hitting on me?

AUNT EMMA (V.O.)

Stability, dear.  Family.  

AUNT EMMA

AUNT EMMA (CONTD)

You take care of my niece, my 
love.  And Ill take care of 
everything over here. 

(a beat) 

Ah, once upon a time...

JORDAN (V.O.)

When I got home, I realized there 
was no way Aunt Emma could smuggle 
that much cash by herself. I 
racked my brain for another person 
with a foreign passport.

CHANTALLE

Bra-had, theese tape eez focking 
steeky!

JORDAN  (V.O.)

As a successful drug dealer, Brad  
spent his winters in the South of 
France, which is where he met his 
wife Chantalle, a stripper of 
Slovenian origin but born in, of 
all places, Switzerland.  

Take eet off, Bra-had!  Eet erts!

CHANTALLE

Shut up, bitch.

BRAD

CHANTALLE

You beetch, you focking douche-a-
bag-a!

Take eet off!  Take eet off!

DONNIE

JORDAN
Well, this is fucked.

NAOMI

Its gonna take her like fifty 
trips.  

BRAD

Well get her parents to tape up 
too.  They got Swiss passports.  
Plus her brother and his wife.  
Five people, six-seven trips?  

How muchll they want for it?

JORDAN

BRAD

I dunno, not much.  Fuck, theyd 
probably do it just for the miles.

What about my money?  

DONNIE

What?

BRAD

DONNIE

My money.  I got a few mil of my 
own I wanna move.  Ill call you, 
you can come pick it up.

BRAD

(takes offense to 
Donnies 
presumption)

Youll call me.

DONNIE

(what part dont you 
understand?)

And you can come pick it up.

Whats wrong?

JORDAN

BRAD

Dont make me deal with this 
fucknut, okay?

Donnie?  Hes just high is all.

JORDAN

BRAD

I dunno if hes stupid or a junkie 
but hes a loose fuckin cannon.  
I dont trust him and I dont want 
him around me.

JORDAN

Jesus.  I thought he was your best 
customer.

BRAD

I only sell to him cuz hes your 
friend.

Can you just do one trip for him?

JORDAN

BRAD

Ill meet him but I wont pick up.  
I have a limit of how much of that 
douchebag I can take.

I can hear you, motherfucker!

DONNIE

DONNIE (CONTD)

Im a douchebag?!!  Well, whose 
fucking idea was it made us all 
this money?!!  Who fucking knew 
Steve Madden?!!  This douchebag!!  
So go fuck yourself a little!

JORDAN (V.O.)

The next day, Aunt Emma flew to 
Geneva, two million in cash in her 
carry-on.

JORDAN (V.O.)

Which in the big picture was a 
drop in the Swiss bucket --

JORDAN (V.O.)

-- because the following month, 
over the course of six round-
trips, Chantalle and her family 
smuggled in over twenty million 
without even a hiccup.

DONNIE
Fu Manchu!  Kung fu!

DONNIE (CONTD)

Im just fucking with you, man.  
Jesus, the look on your face.  

(Brad isnt laughing)

Hey, sorry if I got outta line the 
other day, I was just, that was 
the drugs talking...

Scool, just... gimme the case.

BRAD

DONNIE

(he doesnt)

You know, I always kinda regretted 
you didnt come to work with us at 
Stratton.  Itd be so cool having 
you around, man.

BRAD

(growing impatient)

Yeah, well...

DONNIE

Youd be one of us, wed go out-
partying together, you wouldnt 
have to dress like a mall rat 
guinea prison bitch all the time.

BRAD
Give me the money.

DONNIE

Can I come over and help tape this 
to your wife?  Eez so focking 
steeky!  Take eet off, Bra-hod!

Im gonna give you a pass.

BRAD

Youre what?

DONNIE

Im gonna give you a pass.

BRAD

Youre gonna give me a pass?

DONNIE

Yes.  Just gimme the money.

BRAD

DONNIE

Youre gonna give me a pass?  
Okay... 

(offers the case)

Why dont you stick your pass up 
your Slavic cunts pussy. 

Shit!

BRAD

POLICE
Freeze!  Dont move!

DONNIE

Jord, do I have a surprise for 
you. Twenty real lemons! A retired 
pharmacist friend of mines been 
sitting on these the last 15 
years. 

You fucking serious?!  

JORDAN

JORDAN (V.O.) (CONTD)

The Lemmon 714 was the Holy Grail 
of Quaaludes, outlawed since the 
80s and three times as powerful 
as anything available today.  For 
a Quaalude addict, it was like 
finding a 1952 Chateau Margaux.

DONNIE(V.O.)

Id been saving these for a 
special occasion, like a birthday 
or celebrating our money being out 
of the country.  Instead I thought 
Id better use em to help break 
the news about Brad.  

JORDAN (V.O.)

That night I cleared my schedule 
and rid my body of anything that 
could fuck with my high.  It was 
celebration time.

Start with one, see how it goes?  

JORDAN

DONNIE

My guy says ones all well need.  
Salut. 

JORDAN
You feeling anything?

Nope.  

DONNIE

(glances at watch)

Thirty five minutes.

JORDAN

Maybe weve built up a tolerance  
all these years?  

DONNIE

This is bullshit, man.  My fucking 
metabolisms pumping and I dont 
feel shit.

JORDAN

Theyre old, maybe they lost their 
potency.

DONNIE

January 81.  Theyre fucking 
duds.  

What are you two retards doing?

NAOMI

Nothing.  Working out. 

JORDAN

NAOMI
(a look; then)

Bo Dietls on the phone.

JORDAN
Bo, hey, whats up? 

BO DIETL

I need to talk to you, but not on 
this phone.

Why, whats--

JORDAN

BO DIETL

Leave the house, call me back   
from a pay phone, you hear me?

JORDAN (V.O.)

The Brookville Country Club was a 
WASP stronghold, a straight shot 
down the road from my house.

Jordan?

BO DIETL (O.S.)

JORDAN

Yeah, Im at a pay phone.  Whats 
going on?

Your buddy Brads in jail.  

BO DIETL

Oh, Jesus Christ! What did he do? 

JORDAN

BO DIETL

I dunno yet, they arrested him in 
a shopping mall in Long Island 
this morning, Im finding out.  
But listen to me.  More important 
than that.  The guy Denham I told 
you about, the Fed?  Hes got your 
phones tapped, Im pretty sure.  
Home and office. 

JORDAN

Donnie, that piece of shit. Im 
gonna kill him! That fat prick 
mother fucker!

BO DIETL

But, listen to me. Do me a favor, 
please do not talk on the phone.

Fuck!

JORDAN

BO DIETL

Did you try to bribe this fuckin 
guy?

JORDAN

What?  No!  I didnt try to bribe 
anybody!

BO DIETL 

Jordan?  I couldnt understand 
you.  Say that again?

I zay I zint ty zoo bibe azybuzzy!

JORDAN

Are you fucking high?

BO DIETL

JORDAN (V.O.)

After fifteen years in storage, 
the Lemmons had developed a 
delayed fuse.  

JORDAN (V.O.)

It took 90 minutes for the little 
fuckers to kick in, but once they 
did -- pow!  I had skipped the 
tingle phase and went straight to 
the drool phase.

JORDAN (V.O.)

Actually Id discovered a new 
phase: the cerebral palsy phase.

BO DIETL (O.S.)

(over phone)

Jordan! Jordan!  Do not get behind 
the wheel!  Just tell me where 
youre at, I'll send Rocco!

Cmon, stand up!  

JORDAN (V.O.)

JORDAN  (V.O.)

Okay, walking is off the list of 
options.  All right, what else is 
there?    

(a brainstorm)

I can crawl, like Skylar!  

JORDAN (V.O.)

Fuck!  The kid makes it look so 
easy! 

JORDAN (V.O.)

Wait, Ive got it! 

Think, you motherfucker, think!

(a few beats; then)

I can roll!

JORDAN (V.O.)

...ello?

JORDAN

Omigod!  Jordan, where are you?!

NAOMI (O.S.)

Whazz a marra?

JORDAN

NAOMI (O.S.)

Its Donnie, hes totally out of 
control!  Hes on the other line 
with some Swiss guy!

Whaa?!!  No!! 

JORDAN

NAOMI (O.S.)

I cant understand you!  Just get 
home, hurry!

JORDAN (V.O.)

They say God protects drunks and 
babies.  I was praying the same 
held true for drug addicts.

JORDAN (V.O.)

I was less than a mile from home 
and drove slower than shit.     

JORDAN (V.O.)

Somehow I made it alive, not a 
scratch on me or the car.  

Where Zonnie?!

JORDAN

In the kitchen.

NAOMI

DONNIE

(into phone)

--zee money, I wazza move izz to 
Zwizzyland...

SAUREL

What language are you speaking, 
Mr. Azoff?

Ge ozza zone!  Ge ozza iz!!

JORDAN

DONNIE

NAOMI

DONNIE

DONNIE

JORDAN

WUZZ?!

DONNIE

NAOMI

Omigod, hes choking!  Jordan, do 
something!!  

Hes not breathing!

NAOMI (CONTD)

Save him! 

NAOMI (CONTD)

JORDAN (V.O.)

This stupid sonovabitch!  All 
Donnie ever did was fuck me up and 
now I had to save his life cause 
I took a CPR class when the baby 
was learning to swim.  Just for 
the record, I want it noted: not 
for a second did I even think 
about letting him choke to death, 
even though it wouldve saved me 
an awful lot of headaches.

JORDAN
He wont come back!  

NAOMI

Dont let him die!  He has 
children!

Jordan Belfort? 

BROOKVILLE POLICE #1 (V.O.)

Yes?

JORDAN

BROOKVILLE POLICE #1

Sir, we need to ask you some 
questions.

JORDAN (V.O.)

Wow.  Maybe I hadnt made it home 
okay.

JORDAN (V.O.) 
It was an absolute miracle I 
wasnt killed, and an even bigger 
miracle I hadnt killed anyone.

JORDAN (V.O.)

But they couldnt arrest me, the 
cops had no proof Id been behind 
the wheel.  Meanwhile, Brad did a 
few months in jail for contempt 
because he wouldnt rat Donnie 
out.  They never found his gun, 
though, so they finally had to let 
him go.  

MANNY RISKIN

Youre a lucky guy, Jordan. 
Legally Ive never seen anyone 
slip a noose the way you do.  
Christ, youre lucky to be alive 
much less not in jail.

I dont believe in luck.

JORDAN

MANNY RISKIN

Thats what all lucky people say.
Its time, Jordan.  Let me make a 
deal with SEC.  Before your luck 
runs out.

What kind of terms?

JORDAN

MANNY RISKIN

You plead guilty to a handful of 
securities violations -- stock 
manipulation, high pressure sales 
tactics, ticky-tack shit like 
that.  You pay a few million 
dollars in fines and in exchange 
the SEC fucks off for all time.

And Stratton?  What happens there?

JORDAN

MANNY RISKIN

Youd have to walk away.  Let 
Donnie take over.

(that one hurts)

Now the FBIs a different animal.  
They can still pursue you for 
criminal wrongdoing.  But with you 
on the sidelines, my guess is your 
best friend Agent Denhamll be 
left standing around with his dick 
in his hand.

MAX

You beat them, Jordan.  You won.   
Sail into the sunset with your 
wife and kids while you can.  

MANNY RISKIN

God knows youll never have to 
work again. 

JORDAN

Im sure many of you have been 
hearing rumors lately, about me, 
about the future of this firm, and 
thats what Id like to talk to 
you about today.    

(a few beats, then)

Five years ago when I started 
Stratton with Donnie Azoff, I knew 
the day would eventually come when  
Id be moving on.  Its truly with 
a heavy heart that I tell you that 
day is here.

JORDAN (CONTD)

Thank you for that and for your 
years of incredible loyalty and 
admiration.  

JORDAN (CONTD)

The point is though, that under 
Donnies leadership, along with 
Robbie Feinberg and Nicky Koskoff 
moving into key management 
positions, this place is gonna be 
better than ever!  

JORDAN (CONTD)

And the fact that I'm gone wont 
stop me from giving Donnie advice, 
not that he needs any--

DONNIE

(jumping in)

Why would anyone in their right 
mind not follow JB's advice?

JORDAN

Before I go, theres something I 
want to remind you all, and thats 
this -- Stratton Oakmont is bigger 
than any one person, even me.  
Especially me.  You guys are 
Stratton, each and every one of 
you, and that is why its sure to 
remain the best brokerage firm in 
the fucking world!

JORDAN (CONTD)

See, the very idea of Stratton is 
that when you come here and step 
into this bullpen for the first 
time, you start your life anew. 
You have a place here and no one 
can take that away from you!  
Stratton Oakmont is America!  Give 
me your tired and poor!  The very 
moment you walk through that door 
and pledge your loyalty to this 
firm, you become part of a family, 
you become a Strattonite!  It 
doesnt matter who you are, it 
doesnt matter where youre from!  
Whether your family came over on 
the Mayflower or on a fucking 
inner tube from Haiti!  

JORDAN (CONTD)

Everybody here knows Kimmie 
Belzer, right?

JORDAN (CONTD)

In case any of you weren't aware 
of it, Kimmie was one of 
Stratton's first brokers, one of 
the original twenty.  Now when 
most of you met Kimmie, you met 
her the way she is today -- a 
beautiful woman who drives a brand 
new Mercedes, a woman who lives in 
the finest condo complex on Long 
Island.  A woman who wears $3000 
Armani suits, who spends her 
winters in the Bahamas and her 
summers in the Hamptons!  

JORDAN (CONTD)

But thats not the Kimmie I met.  
The Kimmie I met was broke, a 
single mom on the balls of her 
ass.  Three months behind on her 
rent with an eight year old son!  
She came to me for a job and when 
I hired her she asked for a $5000 
dollar advance so she could pay 
his tuition.  And what did I do, 
Kimmie?

You wrote me a check for $25,000!

KIMMIE

JORDAN

Because I believed in you, like   
I believe in each and every one  
of you!  

KIMMIE
I love you, Jordan!  

JORDAN

You know for years Ive been 
telling you guys not to take no 
for an answer, to keep pushing,  
to not hang up the phone till you 
get what you want.  This deal Im 
about to sign, barring me from the 
securities industry, barring me 
from Stratton, my home... What the 
fuck is that?  Ill tell you what 
it is, its me being a hypocrite.  
Its me taking no for an answer, 
its them selling me, not the 
other way around!  Fuck it, Im 
not leaving!   

THE SHOW GOES ON!!

JORDAN (CONTD)

JORDAN  (V.O.)

Of course, the troops werent the 
only ones who were thrilled.

JORDAN (V.O.)

I apologized to Brad and promised 
him hed never have to deal with 
Donnie again.  Even offered to pay 
him for his time in the can.  But 
he said no, he was out.  Sad thing 
was, he was dead two years later.  
Massive heart attack while sitting 
on the john.

JORDAN (V.O.) 

Within days, subpoenas started 
flying.  They were burying me in 
paper -- 

JORDAN (V.O.)

-- notices to produce documents, 
depositions.  Donnie couldnt 
drink water fast enough.

JORDAN (V.O.)

They interrogated everybody, it 
went on for months.  It was total 
fucking harassment...  

JORDAN (V.O.)

... but not a single Strattonite  
cracked.  Donnie and I were given 
strict instructions not to leave 
the country...

JORDAN (V.O.)

...so we took our wives to Italy. 
Each of us had a couple of million 
we needed to deposit anyway --

JORDAN (V.O.)

-- this seemed the most civilized 
way to transport it overseas.

HOSTESS

Can I get you anything else, 
gentlemen?

JORDAN

I have a rare condition that 
requires me to drink one of these 
every fifteen minutes.  If you 
could set your egg timer, Id 
appreciate it.

Rugrat! Bongiorno, my bald eagle!

DONNIE

RUGRAT

We may have a problem. Your 
friend, Steve Madden, hes 
unloading shares.

What?!  Youre fucking kidding?!

DONNIE

No. I wish I was. 

RUGRAT

DONNIE

(to Jordan)

Rugrat says Steve Maddens 
unloading shares.

JORDAN

What?! (Grabs Donnies phone) 
Rugrat, what the fuck? 

JORDAN (CONT'D)

(Hands Donnie his phone) Call the 
sonovabitch! Hold on a second. 

RUGRAT

Im looking at the screen and huge 
chunks of Steve Madden are being 
sold. Were not doing it so its 
gotta be Steve. Hes the only 
person who owns that many shares.

DONNIE
Hes not picking up.

JORDAN

Your fucking friend is trying to 
fuck me.  And you know where hes 
trying to fuck me?  Up the ass.

(back to Rugrat)

I need some time to think.

JORDAN (V.O.)

Even though I owned 85% of Steve-
Cocksucker-Madden-fucking-Shoes, 
the shares were in his fucking 
name.  Motherfucker knew I was in 
trouble with the Feds and was 
trying to take advantage.

JORDAN

Tell all the brokers to sell.  
Drive the price down. Steve will 
go cockless when he watches me 
turn his company into a penny 
stock.

(he hangs up)

Sonovacunt!

(yelling below deck)

Captain Ted!!  Start er up, we 
gotta go home!  

What the fuck?!  What happened?

JORDAN (CONTD)

NAOMI

I got a call from cousin Betty.  
Aunt Emmas dead.

JORDAN (V.O.)

Fucking heart attack.  Boom-snap, 
she was gone.  Shuffled off her 
mortal coil and twenty million 
dollars in a Swiss bank account.

SAUREL

It is terrible.  Your aunt was 
such an elegant, attractive woman.  
My condolences to you and your 
family.  You must be --

JORDAN

(no time for it)

Thanks but where does this leave 
us in regard to her account?  It 
goes into probate or what?

SAUREL

Not to worry, Jordan.  Your aunt, 
before she died, signed a document 
naming you as her successor. 

She did?!

JORDAN

SAUREL

(a sly grin)

Well.  Not as of yet.

JORDAN (V.O.)

I gotta say, these Swiss were 
sneaky motherfuckers.  Within 
minutes he made arrangements to 
set me up with a forger, the best 
document specialist in Geneva.  

JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Thing was: I had to get there in 
three business days to co-sign on 
the account.  

JORDAN

Captain Ted!  Change of plan! 
Were going to Monaco. 

Monaco, now?

NAOMI

JORDAN

Yes, babe. Were going to Monaco 
so then we can go to Switzerland. 

HILDY

But her aunt just died, we cant 
go to --

JORDAN

I realize that but we have to go 
to Switzerland. 

What about --

DONNIE

JORDAN

(way ahead of him)

-- keep calling, when the fuck 
picks up, set a meet with him in 
three business days.

We gotta go to London.

NAOMI

Why?!

The funeral.

JORDAN

NAOMI

JORDAN

Honey, I loved your Aunt Emma more 
than anyone in the world, but 
shes still gonna be dead in two 
days. Shes not going anywhere. 

JORDAN (CONTD)

Captain Ted, weve gotta get to 
Monaco.

Monaco?

CAPTAIN TED

JORDAN

Then we drive to Switzerland so 
they dont stamp our passports. 
Take care of business. Drive back 
to Monaco, fly to London for the 
funeral, fly back to New York to 
be there in three business days - 
Thats the fuckin plan.

CAPTAIN TED

Im getting reports of some 
weather out there.  Might run into 
some chop.

JORDAN

The boats 170 feet long.  She can 
handle a little chop.  

HILDY

Were not going anywhere until he 
says its safe. 

Chop is fine. 

Is it safe? 

DONNIE

JORDAN

If we take it slow...

CAPTAIN TED

We can do it? 

JORDAN

CAPTAIN TED

Chop is chop. Some chop - it can 
be uncomfortable. 

Well, thats fine. 

JORDAN

CAPTAIN TED

Anything is possible. I mean well 
have to batten down the hatches 
just to be safe. Could be a few 
broken dishes. 

JORDAN

A few broken dishes. Isnt that 
great? Lets go to Monaco - 

JORDAN (V.O.)
Well talk about your shitty 
vacations...  

What the fuck is going on? 

JORDAN

Jet skis just went overboard.

CAPTAIN TED

Gale warning!  Gale warning!

RADIO VOICE

CAPTAIN TED 

The waves are twenty feet and 
building! 

Cant you turn us around?!

JORDAN

CAPTAIN TED

Well get broad-sided and tip 
over!

Gale warning!  Gale warning!

RADIO VOICE 

NAOMI

You happy now, you piece of shit? 
Were gonna drown.

JORDAN

Im a master diver. We will not 
drown, I promise you. I got you, 
baby.

(realizing shes 
probably right; to 
Donnie)

The ludes!

What?

DONNIE 

Get the fucking ludes!

JORDAN

DONNIE 

Theyre below deck! Theres like 
three feet of water down there!

I cant die fucking sober!

JORDAN

NAOMI

What is he crazy? Wheres he 
going? Donnie!

Jesus Christ!  

CAPTAIN TED

Whats happening?!

JORDAN

Rogue wave! 

CAPTAIN TED

CAPTAIN TED (CONTD)

(into radio)

Mayday!  This is Captain Ted 
Beecham aboard the Yacht Naomi! 
This is a Mayday!  

CAPTAIN TED (CONTD)

We are going down at the head 
fifty miles off the coast of Rome 
and we require immediate 
assistance!

JORDAN (V.O.)

The nice thing about getting 
rescued by Italians is that the 
first thing they do is feed you 
and make you drink red wine.   
Then they make you dance.

JORDAN (V.O.)

Did you see that?  That was the 
plane I sent for to come get us.  
I shit you not, it exploded when  
a seagull flew into the engine, 
three people killed.  You want a 
sign from God, well after all this 
I finally got the message.  I had 
to make some fucking changes. 

Dinners ready.

NAOMI

JORDAN

I gotta finish these balance 
sheets, babe. 

NAOMI

Well, its there. So the kids are 
gonna start. 

JORDAN (V.O.)

Whats the single most important 
skill in life you can ever master?

JORDAN

At the essence of every personal 
interaction, of every business 
transaction, of every effective 
human communication is 
PERSUASION... once you learn to 
control the linguistic encounter, 
you will be SHOCKED at what will 
happen... you are a person worth 
listening to, and taking it one 
step higher than that, you are 
someone who can help them achieve 
their goals...

JORDAN (CONTD)

Do you dream of being financially 
independent but struggle every 
month just to pay your bills?  
Would you like to own a home like 
this one someday but can barely 
afford to pay your rent?

(ZOOM IN ON HIM)

My name is Jordan Belfort and 
theres no secret to wealth 
creation.  No matter who you are, 
where you came from, you too can 
become financially independent in 
just a matter of months.  All you 
need is a strategy.

(NEW ANGLE; he enters 
from same side as 
previous shot)

JORDAN (CONTD)

The first action you have to take 
is to DECIDE to be wealthy.  When 
I was 24 years old, I made a 
DECISION not to just survive but 
to THRIVE.  I started my own stock 
brokerage firm, developing a 
SYSTEM OF SELLING that within a 
year made me a multi-millionaire. 

JORDAN (V.O.)

From these humble middle-class 
beginnings, I now live here...with 
my beautiful wife and 
kids...living the lifestyle of our 
dreams...

JORDAN (V.O.)

Now Im passing along the secrets 
to my success in my 90-minute free 
seminar, Jordan Belforts 
Straight Line Persuasion.

MAN

I have here in my hand, framed, is 
a check for twenty-seven thousand 
four hundred and thirty-seven 
dollars and sixty-three cents that 
I netted from one deal after 
attending Jordan Belforts, um, 
Straight Line Persuasion seminar.

JORDAN

Theres nobody stopping you from 
making millions.  There is nobody 
holding you back from financial 
freedom.

(to Naomi)

Thank You Sweet Heart.
(back to camera)

Dont just sit at home or the life 
of your dreams will sail right 
past you.

HUSBAND

Thanks to the Straight Line 
System, we could afford this home 
and now were living the lives of 
our dreams.

JORDAN (V.O.)

Ive changed all these peoples 
lives and I can change yours, too!

JORDAN

So come to my seminar!!  The life 
of your dreams is only a decision 
away --

JORDAN (V.O.)

This one takes the cake.  It was 
Rugrat, hed been busted down in 
Miami, and guess who the fuck 
with? 

JORDAN (V.O.)

What were the odds?  There had to 
be ten thousand Swiss bankers in 
Geneva and I choose the one dumb 
enough to get himself arrested on 
U.S. soil.  

JORDAN (V.O.)

Even more ironic was he'd gotten 
himself indicted on charges that 
had nothing to fucking do with me. 

JORDAN (V.O.)

Something about laundering drug 
money through offshore boat racing 
and a guy named Rocky Aoki, the 
founder of Benihana.

JORDAN (V.O.)

Beni-fucking-hana!  Why would God 
be so cruel as to choose a chain 
of fucking Hibachi Restaurants to 
bring me down?

JORDAN (V.O.) 

Long story short was Saurel ratted 
me out, but not before he ratted 
out Chantalle, who it turns out 
hed been fucking every time she 
went to Switzerland!

JORDAN (V.O.)

I was indicted for money 
laundering, securities fraud and  
an endless list of other shit.

HON. SAMANTHA STOGEL

(leafing through a 
subpoena)

One count engaging in conspiracy 
to commit securities fraud.  Two 
counts securities fraud.  One 
count engaging in conspiracy to 
commit money laundering.  Twenty-
one counts money laundering.  One 
count obstruction of justice.

(gives Jordan a 
withering glare)

Bail is set at ten million 
dollars.

NOLAN DRAGER

This is...well, its not good.  
Its pretty bad actually.  How 
much money do you have, Jordan?

I can make bail.

JORDAN

NOLAN DRAGER

I dont mean the ten million, I 
mean for legal fees.  Cuz if you 
want to fight this thing, its 
gonna be expensive.  Like, sell-
everything-you-own-expensive.

JORDAN

Nay, thank God.  Im so glad 
youre here.

DONNIE

Hey, everybody!  Howre the 
happiest people in Long Island?  
Hi, Rocky!!

(joining Jordan)
Hate that fucking dog.

JORDAN

Tell me about it.  Its getting 
old, starting to shit inside the 
house again.

DONNIE

How you doing, brother?  How was 
the food in jail?

JORDAN

Lobster Newburg sucked.  They gave 
me some jewelry though.

DONNIE

Wonder if they got one in my size.  
Fuckin Rugrat, that wig-wearin 
hump.  Tell you one thing: Im 
never eating at Benihanas again.  
Wheres Naomi?

Inside.  Pissed.

JORDAN

Whats up her ass?

DONNIE

JORDAN

Had to mortgage the home to make 
bail.  Probably gonna hafta sell 
it to pay my lawyers.  If we fight 
this thing.

DONNIE

The Feds say anything about coming 
after the rest of us?

DONNIE (CONTD)

You know, were all behind you.  
Everyone at the office.  

(he removes an 
envelope, hands it 
to Jordan)

We bought back your mortgage.  All 
the founding partners threw in a 
million apiece.  Figured none of 
us would have it if it werent for 
you.

You gotta fight this thing, baby.

DONNIE (CONTD)

JORDAN (V.O.)

Like I said, loyalty meant a lot 
to me.  Without your friends and 
family standing behind you, youre 
fucked.

LUCAS SOLOMON

Theres a term we have around 
here, we dont like to use it 
often, only when circumstances 
dictate.  Its called a Grenada.  
Inspired by our governments 
invasion in 1983 of the island 
nation of only 90,000 people, 
basically it stands for any case 
we get which is pretty much unlose-
able.  We could show up late and 
drunk to court, fuck up left-right-
and-center and still wed win.  
Mr. Belfort, you, sir, are a 
Grenada.

ROCHELLE APPLEBAUM

Youre looking at real prison 
time.  Money laundering gets you 
as much as 20 years.  Case 
couldnt be stronger if wed have 
caught you with your cash in your 
mattress.

Read the discovery.

LUCAS SOLOMON

That your lifes work in the box?

JORDAN

AGENT DENHAM

Jordan, you rotting in jail til 
your kidsre outta college isnt 
our ambition here.  You werent 
the only one involved in all this.  
We think those folks deserve their 
day in court too.

NOLAN DRAGER 

Why do I get the sense theres an 
offer in the air?  If so, lets 
put it on the table. 

LUCAS SOLOMON

Full cooperation.  A comprehensive 
list of all coconspirators 
spanning the last seven years and 
he agrees to wear a wire. 

You want me to rat?

JORDAN

We want your cooperation in --

LUCAS SOLOMON

Yes.  We want you to rat.

AGENT DENHAM 

How was Christys party?

JORDAN

It was fine. 

NAOMI

JORDAN

Baby, I talked to the lawyers 
again today. I have some really 
great news. As it turns out youre 
totally off the hook. 

NAOMI
I know that already.

JORDAN

You never did anything wrong 
anyway, right? At the end of the 
day all they really want is for me 
to cooperate - thats it. 
See, apparently, I know so much 
about whats going on in the stock 
market that I could save the 
government years of heartache. But 
it gets even better... You see, 
if I cooperate Ill only have to 
serve four short years and any 
fine Id have to pay wouldnt be 
due til after I serve my sentence. 
Well still have plenty of money 
left over. The only thing that I 
was kind of upset about was the 
fact that I might have to give 
them information about my friends.

NAOMI

Like you said, Theres no friends 
on Wall Street.

JORDAN

But theres a silver lining to 
that too... It turns out that all 
of em are probably gonna 
cooperate too. So in the end, that 
wont really be a factor.

NAOMI

Well, thats really good news, 
honey. Im really happy for you. 

No, its good for both of us, Nay. 

JORDAN

Yeah, yeah.

NAOMI

JORDAN

Make love to me baby. Make love to 
me nice and slow.

No Jordan. Stop!

NAOMI

JORDAN

I love you, Nay. I love you so 
much. Ive loved you from the 
first time I saw you. 

Fuck you. 

What? 

NAOMI

JORDAN

NAOMI
I fucking hate you.

What are you talking about?

JORDAN

NAOMI

You dont give a shit about how I 
feel. All you care about is 
yourself. 

Thats not true. What do you mean?

JORDAN

NAOMI

You wanna fuck me? Fine. Fuck me 
hard like its the last time.

JORDAN

Hold still. Why are you moving 
like that? 

NAOMI
Go ahead, fuck me! 

What are you doing baby? 

JORDAN

NAOMI

Cum for me. Cum for me, baby. Like 
its the last time.

You want me to cum, baby?

JORDAN

Yeah, cum for me baby, cum! 

NAOMI

NAOMI (CONTD)

Jordan, that was the last time. I 
want a divorce. 

What are you talking about?

JORDAN

I want a divorce. 

NAOMI

JORDAN

What? What are you talking about? 
Now? After we just made love? 

And I wanted to puke. 

NAOMI

NAOMI (CONTD)

I dont love you anymore Jordan. I 
havent for a long time. 

JORDAN

You dont love me? Isnt that 
convenient. Now, you dont love 
me? Now while Im under federal 
indictment with a fucking bracelet 
around my ankle? Now, all of a 
sudden, you decide you dont love 
me?

NAOMI
Yes, thats right. 

What kind of a person are you?

JORDAN

NAOMI

You married me. This is how its 
gonna be. Listen Jordan. Im 
taking custody of the kids. If you 
agree to the divorce right now, I 
will allow you visitation. Dont 
try to fight it. It will save us 
both a lot of money and I have a 
feeling youre gonna need it. 

JORDAN

Ive got news for you. Youre not 
taking my kids. 

NAOMI

I already spoke to my lawyer. He 
said even if you dont get 
convicted I can still get custody. 

JORDAN

My lawyers are more powerful than 
yours. Youre not taking my kids! 
You vicious cunt!

JORDAN (CONTD)

Fuck you! Youre not taking my 
kids. You fucking bitch!

NAOMI

Look at yourself Jordan. Youre 
sick, youre a sick man. 

Youre not taking my kids.

JORDAN

NAOMI

You think Id let my kids near 
you? Look at you. You know what my 
lawyers said? Youre going to jail 
for twenty years. Twenty fucking 
years, Jordan. Youll be lucky if 
you ever see them again.

JORDAN

Oh yeah? You dont think Im gonna 
see my kids again? Oh yeah?

Put her down Jordan! Put her down!

NAOMI

NAOMI (CONTD)

Violet, Violet! Help me! Hes got 
Skylar! Get the key!

JORDAN

JORDAN (V.O.)

For the next six hours, I came up 
with a list.  Friends, enemies, 
business associates, anybody whod 
ever known me or taken so much as 
a stock tip.  The first name on 
the list was Donnies.  

AGENT DENHAM

Talk normally, breathe normally, 
within five minutes youll forget 
you even have it on.  

JORDAN

The trial wont be for months,   
so obviously Ill be counting on 
you to pick up the slack.  

DONNIE

Whatever you need, bro.  You know 
that.

JORDAN

And you know how much that means 
to me.  Hey, you know what I 
wanted to ask you?  

JORDAN (CONTD)

The Steve Madden deal, did he  
ever come through on that?  

JORDAN (CONTD)

Remember he was supposed to kick 
back like four mil from that one 
account?  

DONNIE

Uh... tell you the truth I was so 
fucked up, I dont really remember 
anything about that.

JORDAN

Well if you talk to him, let me 
know.  You want the last 
yellowtail?

Why not?

DONNIE

JORDAN (V.O.)

And thus began my career as a 
government cooperator.  I was a 
rat... 

JORDAN (V.O.)

But I wasnt losing any sleep  
over it. 

VIOLET

Im sorry, Mr. Jordan.  You got a 
visitor.  

AGENT DENHAM
I need you to get dressed.

Why?  Whats going on? 

JORDAN

Youre going to jail.

AGENT DENHAM

JORDAN (V.O.)

Donnie Azoff, my partner.  My best 
friend.  

JORDAN (V.O.)

After months of legal wrangling,  
I was finally sentenced to prison.  

JORDAN (V.O.)

I gave up everyone, and in return 
got three years in some hellhole 
in Nevada Id never even heard of.  
Like Mad Maxd said, the 
chickensd come home to roost.  
Whatever the fuck that means.

NOLAN DRAGER

I hope your Honor would agree that 
Mr. Belfort has distinguished 
himself in terms of his 
cooperation in this white collar 
fraud.  Mr. Belfort has helped the 
government win convictions over 
two dozen serious offenders and 
helped them recover millions of 
dollars to be made available for 
restitution to the victims.

HON. RAYMOND SAMITZ

The sentence of the court shall be 
48 months in Federal Prison. 

(pause)

Please remand the defendant.

JORDAN (V.O.)

Im not ashamed to admit, when we 
arrived to prison, I was 
absolutely terrified...

Belfort!  Fuckin move!

GUARD (O.S.)

I neednt have been.

JORDAN (V.O.)

JORDAN

Sorry, just out.  What is that, 
forty-thirty?

JORDAN (V.O.)

For a brief, fleeting moment, Id 
forgotten I was rich and lived in 
America.

AFRICAN KID

I watch him speak and what he says 
is motivational about life.  He 
tells about life and how you can 
be more rich.

CHINESE KID

He is going to teach us how to be 
successful, how to set our goals. 

INDIAN KID

I will build my future by using 
Jordan Belfort as my mentor.

MEXICAN KID

Choosing what is good from him and 
being a millionaire. 

MAN WITH A MIC

Ladies and gentlemen, please join 
me in welcoming to Auckland, New 
Zealand... Mr. Jordan Belfort!

Jordan Belfort spent 22 months in federal prison 

and paid $100,000,000 in fines.

His cellmate was, no fucking joke, Tommy Chong.
