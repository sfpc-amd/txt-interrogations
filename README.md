### Converting PDF to .txt

The quickest & easiest way I was able to do this was to use Automator on a Mac. See `bin/pdf2txt.workflow`. Currently it will simply output the text to your `Desktop` folder. This isn't the best solution but it gets the job done.

It would make sense to find a good python workflow for this, some possible resources:
